This diskette only contains three segments of the spelling dictionary.
It will need to be copied to the same disk containing the rest of the
segments from volumes 7 and 9.  Note that the complete dictionary
in 14 segments requires 592 blocks so that it will not all fit on even
a double density diskette.

Each segment is an indexed file which was made about 10-20% larger
than necessary for the present size of the dictionary.  That means
that it could be shortened to just about fit on one double density 8
inch diskette.  But, I'll leave that up to you, if you are so inclined.


**********************     N  O  T  E     **********************
ALL COMMERCIAL RIGHTS FOR ALL SOFTWARE CONTAINED ON THIS DISKETTE
ARE RESERVED FOR THE AUTHORS, UNLESS EXPLICITLY STATED OTHERWISE.

Basically, that means that software contributed by authors to the
OUG library is intended to be used by end users only.  In some cases
this condition is noted in the program listing.  In other cases the
OUG has acquired distributorship rights to software that only allows
copies to be "sold" to end users.  In these cases, copies are given
to members who contribute the agreed upon service fee for copying.
The Marin Scientific Instruments dictionary data base fits into
this catagory.

Because software is contributed by members and I cannot personally
investigate the copyright status of each item, you must assume the
possibility that a mistake may have been made by someone along the
way.  If you should discover that some program has gotten into our
library that you think should not be there, please contact me right
away [(805) 965-0265] and I'll try to contact the authors.
