Dear Member,

This volume marks another important advancement in the activities of the
OASIS USERS' GROUP.  For the first time commercial software is included.
We purchased commercial distribution rights for the OASIS USERS' GROUP.
The dictionary file is NOT public domain!  You have a legal copy of it
and under some conditions can share it with other OASIS users in your
geographical area, a condition generally true for anything in the library.
If you have any questions about the copyright status of anything in the
library, contact the author first.  Then, if you still have questions,
get in touch with me.

The SPELCHEK spelling checker probably is not the fastest one available,
but it is certainly one of the least expensive.  And, it does work.  At
least it tells you when words are not in the dictionary.  Unfortunately,
there are a lot of strange non-words in the dictionary too.  I don't know
how it was compiled, but some very unusual "words" show up - like "fred".
In practice this has not proven to be much of a problem in my testing.
I would appreciate feedback on your experiences in using it.  And, I would
especially like lists of good words you find that are not now in the
dictionary, or non-words and misspelled words you find that are in it.
I am sure the availability of the dictionary is going to spark some really
interesting new programs.

I spent about a hundred hours getting the system together, including
over 20 hours of computer time just rewriting the file into indexed
segments.  I have a copy of the original sequential file in straight
alphabetical sequence for anyone who wants to do something for us with
that format.

Speaking of hours spent on the OUG, I am spending a lot more time than
I ever imagined it would take processing each new volume for the library.
While this is still somewhat of a labor of love, the honeymoon is over.
Fortunately, the income from fees is growing enough so that it is becoming
worth my while financially.  Thanks folks.

Speaking of income, it has been good enough that I am going to throw in
volume 9 free along with volume 8 to all of you who set up standing orders.
Actually, it makes sense because it takes two volumes + to hold the entire
dictionary.  And, if I don't handle it this way we might end up with more
volumes (and $35 fees) than I have been telling people to expect on the
average.  No big deal, but that's how I see it.

Now I don't want to make anyone feel guilty, but LOTS of you out there
have promised software contributions that have so far not found their
way into the library.  You like to get new stuff, and the main way we add
new volumes to the library is through contributions from our members.
SO GET YOURSELF AWAY FROM THE TV SET AND FINISH THAT PROGRAM YOU PROMISED!

On the subject of new software, if you know of any really good commercial
software or databases we can buy at a reasonable price (much less than
$300 for unlimited rights) for conversion to OASIS and inclusion in our
library, let me know.  It looks like that may be a good way to get new
quality stuff.  That's how we got the SPELCHEK dictionary and the
BusinessMaster II packages.

Our BusinessMaster II conversion has bogged down.  Since the last news
letter there has been no real progress made, of which I am aware.  Now
that SPELCHEK is done I may be able to put a little more time into the
project myself.  Our other partners have all been unable to give any of
their time to the conversion lately.  That's one of the problems with
trying to undertake a big project with an all volunteer team.  I am still
optimistic, though, and will keep you informed.


I am now very much aware that our members have a wide range of versions
of OASIS, varying from 5.3 to 5.5.  Volume 1 had a couple of programs
that had been compiled with version 5.4.  Several people called to say
they couldn't run them with 5.5.  Now I learn that 5.5 has the capability
of RE-compiling earlier versions so that they will run with 5.5.  All you
have to do is issue the command: BASIC AWARI.BASICCOM.  The system will
then generate a new compiled version.  BEWARE, the old 5.4 version is
REPLACED, so if you want both versions, better make a copy.  I have fixed
the current version of Volume 1 so that an automatic recompile happens
when ever a new user runs the VOL1.EXEC.

Some of you have reported that programs that worked fine with OASIS 5.4
needed minor changes to run under 5.5.  I have taken the precaution of
checking everything in volume 7 with both versions 5.4 and 5.5, and will
plan to do the same for all future volumes.  Let me know if you have any
other problems with anything in our library.

The new computer for our bulletin board system is scheduled for shipment
to us sometime very soon.  I have no idea how long it will take to get
it up and operating with a dedicated phone number.  I do plan to bring
the new system to the Fall COMDEX meeting this month in Los Vegas.  The
folks at Digital Microsystems have promised to try and ship our machine
sometime early this month, so I think it will be available in time for
the meeting at the show.  I hope so, because it will give some of you a
chance to play with it while you are there.

We now have a time and place scheduled for our meeting at COMDEX.  It is:

                        C O M D E X
                        2 P.M. Friday, 20 November, 1981
                        Conference Rooms 7 and 8
                        Los Vegas Hilton Hotel

The agenda is still flexible, but will definitely include a question and
answer period with Phase One personnel and a period for people to make
public announcements about software they expect to have available in the
near future - both commercial and OUG library contributions.  It should
give us a chance to explore new ways of realizing the tremendous potential
of the OASIS operating system.  See you all there.

So much for this news letter.  Unlike most of the others this one is being
sent to all members so that they know of the COMDEX meeting. Most of our
news letters only get "published" on the latest new volume of the library
diskettes (or ONYX tapes).

Happy computing,

Fred L. Bellomy

Hi, Fred!

     At last, here comes my next contribution.  The FILELIST doesn't look like
much, but wait until you try some of these goodies!  Here's what I've done:

     1) ADDRESS/ADDRINFO -- This is an updated version of the ADDRESS program
     I sent to you earlier that you said needed some improvement and explana-
     tion.  ADDRINFO is the explanation file, called by ADDRESS.

     2) BIOPRNT2 is a real PRINTING version of "BIOPRINT" (which just sends
     the biorhythm info to the screen).  I've also cleaned up some minor
     errors and mis-spellings.

     3) DIB is what should be page 148.1 of the MACRO manual: the control
     block description of the Disk Identification Block which is located in
     Sector 1 of every disk.  I had to puzzle this stuff out when I got a
     messed up disk, but thought others might want the information, too.

     4) PLAYBALL is one reason I've been so slow getting stuff to you.  After
     getting slightly hooked on "BASEBALL", (and since the players were on
     strike) I decided to convert it for CRT display.  After a couple of hours
     of working at conversion, I gave up and started over from scratch.  It
     is basically finished, though every once in awhile I come across an ano-
     maly which shouldn't be there.  Rather than hold it any longer, though,
     here it is.  PLEASE ENJOY IT---I've got about 20-25 hours programming
     time in it . . .

     5) REMINDER -- This is my approach to doing what "TICKLER" seems to be
     designed to do.  Again, it turned out to be simpler for me to start over
     rather than patch up "TICKLER".  (If it had not been anonymous I would
     have worked harder at conversion . . .)

     Now, I think/hope that ADDRESS takes care of one of the WISH LIST items,
and "WSEARCH" looks like a working version of the "WORD$PZL" program you asked
me to take a look at, so some progress is being made.  My database system
hasn't gotten much further, however, so don't hold your breath waiting for it.
There are several reasons for that, but one of them warrants a new paragraph:

     Any users out there who have version 5.4F multi-user, BEWARE!  If you
haven't already discovered it, if one user is RUNning a program which writes
to a file, and another user is trying to SAVE a BASICOBJ program, . . .
BOOM!  Both files' directories get grossly messed up (though the data up to
that point is intact), so both files are essentially unusable--in fact, sub-
sequent attempts to re-use either (after re-booting the system) have a marked
tendency to overwrite Sectors 0 and 1 with zeroes: a mildly annoying fatal
condition.

     It took two and a half weeks of frantic work, haggling with Phase One,
etc., to get the problem solved.  The solution:  get version 5.5 (or, better
yet, 5.5A), which, not incidentally, does everything better than 5.4F.  Now
I don't know for sure that this problem applies to other than DIGITAL MICRO-
SYSTEMS owners, but if anyone runs into it, let Phase One know that you are
due for a free 5.5 or better.

     That problem, incidentally, was the impetus for the DIB info included
on this disk.

******************************************************************************

VOLUME 6 IS GREAT!  Definitely the best yet, and FULL!  Zowie, is that worth
the bucks!  Good job!  Congrats!  Thanks!  Etc.!

     The changes you made to ADD and FIND are definite improvements (except
that in creating or re-creating the LIBRARY, the option KEYLENGTH is illegally
abbreviated KEY, rather than KEYL); I'm in the process of reworking our own
LIBRARY to take advantage of the new programs.

     I would suggest changing the name of the master VOL6.EXEC to $VOL6.EXEC
in order to get it at the top of the FILELIST, but other than that, no com-
plaints about the format.  (I'm still not in love with that VOLxx.EXEC ap-
proach, but what the heck, it works . . .)

     Because of the 5.4F problem, and priorities on getting ADDRESS done, and
vacation, and PLAYBALL, and . . . and . . . and . . . I haven't done much ex-
ploration yet of the contents of volumes 4-6.  I will, though, and faithfully
promise to give you some feedback.

     Your "editorial" is great.  Let me recommend for people who are interes-
ted in serious discussion of the current and future state of the microcomputer
revolution an article in a journal called "Sociological Methods & Research".
The article is in Volume 9 Number 4 of the journal (which issue is entirely
devoted to microcomputers in social research), and is called "The Microcom-
puter Revolution?" by Craig Calhoun.  The man has done a pile of research on
where we are now, and his discussion of future possibilities is mind-opening.
Well written, insightful, packed full of information.  If you can't find it
in your library, I'll send you a copy, Fred, which perhaps you could further
disseminate.  It's forty pages long, though, so not cheap to copy.

     Glad to see some serious programming is going on out there; I'm looking
forward to the business package and other things coming.  OASIS is so fantas-
tic, I hope we can really blow everyone away with our stuff.  Let's please
keep trying to produce QUALITY stuff.  I'll keep hacking away, especially at
the data base and the other things you sent.

     The idea of a get-together at the WCCF sounds great, too.  Keep us up
on developments there.

     Quitting time, or I won't get this in the mail to you today, either.
Keep up the good work.

FEED BACK - I DO NOT KNOW WHY BUT I COULD NOT RUN ANY BASICCOM
    FB  BASIC programs were compiled with 5.4 and will not
        run with 5.5.  They must be recompiled.  See the
        new COMPILE EXEC on Vol 6.
          - PROGRAMS  I AGREE WITH THE OTHER USER'S THAT ONLY
          - BASICOBJ PROGRAMS BE INCLUDED.
    FB  Starting with Vol 6 that's how we do it.
          - BETTER YET WOULD BE BASIC THIS FILE CAN BE LISTED
          - IF NEED BE.
    FB  BASIC version takes a little more space.  You can
        now use the COMPILE EXEC to get a BASIC version, too.

          - THE EXEC FILE TO INTRODUCE SHOULD BE EDIT FILES
          - I HAD A HARD TIME READ THE INTRODUCTION BECAUSE
          - MY CRT IS ONLY 24X16 AND THIS WOULD MAKE EASY TO
          - USES THE SCRIPT TO PRINT IT
    FB  Thought about this one a long time.  I think we will
        continue to use the EXEC approach, but take a look
        at the changes that have been made in Vol 5 & 6.

FORMAT   EXEC
IS USE TO FORMAT A DISK, VERIFY IT THEN LOOP
FOR ANOTHER DISK. I USE IT TO TEST DISK
(DISK NAME WILL BE TEST)
    FB  We have a better one in the library already.
GAMES    EXEC
THIS IS YOUR EXEC BUT THE GAMES ARE LISTED IN
GROUPS OF 15  FOR USE 64X16 CRT  (I COULD NOT
GET THIS PROGRAM TO WORK, IT WOULD GIVE ME
"GOTO.COMMAND NOT FOUND"
    FB  I see the problem and will try to fix it.
MAILLIST BASIC
THIS IS A COMPLETE MAILLIST PROGRAM, IT WILL
ADD , EARSE , PRINT (SHEET OF LABELS
3 LABELS WIDE) , REVIEW
    FB  This is being included in Vol 7 with minor mods as MAIL$DS.
MAILLIST DOC      MORE INFO ON ABOVE MAILLIST
OASIS    MAILLIST THE DATA FILE FOR THE MAILLIST
PRINT    EXEC     THIS PROGRAM IS USE TO ATTACH  PRINTER
DRIVERS (ONE IF LINE LENGHT IS UNDER 85
ANOTHER IF OVER)
    FB  This is being included in Vol 7 as PRINTAT EXEC.
WUMPUS   BASICOBJ
THE SAME OLD WUMPUS EXECPT THE WUMPUS IS ALL
THE TIME MOVE AND LEAVES TRACKS IN THE CAVE
IT BEEN IN , PLUS  SOME GOOD OLD
TEXAS EDITORIALS
   FB  This is being included in Vol 7 as WUMPUS2.

WISH LIST - I wish somebody would.......................................
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

1.  We need a general purpose BASIC converter - you know, from any other
BASIC (like BASIC-E) to OASIS BASIC.


3.  We need to develop a cheap way for members to call the new OUG Bulletin
Board computer.  Does anyone know a way to use the networks (ie TELENET,
TYMNET, etc.) or other phone service for cheap "off hours" communications?


5.  We need a clearly written proceedure for setting up new class codes.

6.  We need a conversion routine for converting ASSEMBLY language code
from other Z80 systems to OASIS.

7.  We need a BASIC disassembler.

8.  I need a comprehensive mailing list program for keeping track of all
our members - one that we can put in the public domain.
Thanks for all the contributions on this on. Still don't have what I
want yet.  It needs to operate with SCRIPT as well.

9.  I need a data base system for maintaining the commercial software
directory - again one that can be released into the public domain.

10. We need people who can begin doing benchmark tests of the various
software products that are becoming available - both propriatary and
public domain.

11. We need lots more applications to run against the dictionary data
base.  An assembly version of SPELCHEK would be nice, too.

12. We need someone to make a nice little summary of what is in the
OASIS USERS' GROUP library.  The DISKFILE library program doesn't
give enough information about what each program does.  It should be
a system that can be used for maintaining the information, like Joe
Trimble's DISKFILE library system.

13.

THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAMS ON VOLUME 7.

***************************************************************


ADDRESS.BASICOBJ/ADDRESS.EXEC/ADDRINFO.BASICOBJ

THIS IS A MAILING LIST MAINTAINANCE PROGRAM WRITTEN AND SUBMITTED
BY JOE TRIMBLE.  IT INCLUDES THE MEANS FOR CREATING A NEW MAILING
LIST FILE AS WELL AS FOR ADDING AND MODIFYING IT.

NOTE THAT IT REQUIRES CURSOR ADDRESSING CAPABILITY.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

HECK3.BASICOBJ/CHECK3.EXEC/CHECK3.FIRST/CHECK3.NOTES

THIS IS A CHECKBOOK MAINTAINANCE PROGRAM WRITTEN BY HOWARD DECKER.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

AMES.EXEC

THIS IS THE LATEST VERSION OF THE UTILITY FOR SELECTING GAMES.
DON'T FORGET TO COMPILE ALL THE GAMES BEFORE USING THIS SELECTION
PROGRAM. FB

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

ROWRATE.BASICOBJ

THIS PROGRAM WAS OBTAINED FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE.
IT ALLOWS YOU TO CALCULATE THE RATE OF GROWTH OF ANYTHING
GIVEN SOME HISTORICAL DATA ABOUT IT.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

AIL$DS.BASICOBJ/MAIL$DS.EXEC

THIS IS ANOTHER MAILING LIST MAINTAINANCE SYSTEM WRITTEN AND
SUBMITTED BY DAVID SLATER. IT REQUIRES THE GENERATION OF AN
INDEXED FILE FOR THE MAILING LIST.  THE SYSTEM PROMPTS YOU.
THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS SYSTEM IS VERY LIMITED, BUT IT IS
FAIRLY SELF EXPLANATORY.  IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE
OTHER MAILLIST SYSTEM, SO CHECK THEM BOTH OUT.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

EMBADD.BASICOBJ/MEMBERS.ADDRESS

THIS IS THE LATEST OASIS USERS' GROUP MEMBERSHIP LIST.  THE MEMBADD
PROGRAM IS WHAT IS USED TO ADD NEW MEMBERS TO THE LIST.  THIS IS
NOT THE MOST ELEGANT SYSTEM, BUT IT DOES HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF GIVING
ME AN ASCII SEQUENTIAL FILE I CAN SORT AND USE AS INPUT FOR SCRIPT
PROGRAMS.  IT ASSUMES THAT THE MEMBERS.ADDRESS FILE RESIDES ON THE
"A" DISK.  YOU PROBABLY WILL HAVE NO NEED TO USE IT AND I JUST
INCLUDE IT FOR REFERENCE.

TO SEE AN ALPHABET LISTING OF THE MEMBERS TYPE "RUN" ELSE <CR>:

LAYBALL.BASICOBJ

THIS IS A GREAT NEW GAME OF BASEBALL WRITTEN AND SUBMITTED BY
JOE TRIMBLE.  I'M NOT MUCH ON SPORTS GAMES, MYSELF, BUT THIS
ONE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD!  IT REQUIRES CURSOR ADDRESSING.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

RINTAT.EXEC

THIS IS A FAIRLY SPECIALIZED UTILITY FOR ATTACHING A PRINTER TO
YOUR SYSTEM.  IT WAS WRITTEN AND SUBMITTED BY DAVID SLATER.

FOR MORE INFO NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

EMINDER.BASICOBJ

THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE PROGRAM FOR MAINTAINING A CALENDAR OR
REMINDER LIST.  IT WILL REMIND YOU OF ANYTHING THAT OCCURS
AT ANY REGULAR INTERVAL.  IT WAS WRITTEN AND SUBMITTED BY
OUR OWN JOE TRIMBLE.  HE'S BEEN A BUSY LITTLE BEE AGAIN
AS USUAL.  MY SPECIAL THANKS FOR THIS ONE, JOE.  FRED.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

PELCHEK.BASICOBJ/SPELL.BASICOBJ/SPELLADD.BASICOBJ
SPELSRTI.BASICOBJ/SPELSRTS.BASICOBJ
SPELLING.SIZE13/SIZE15/SIZE4/SIZE5

OK FOLKS, HERE IS A BIGGY!  SPELCHEK IS A DOCUMENT SPELLING CHECKER.
SPELL IS AN ONLINE DICTIONARY.  THE FILES NAMED SPELLING.SIZEn ARE
THE SEGMENTS OF THE DICTIONARY ITSELF.  THE REST OF THE DICTIONARY
SECTIONS ARE ON VOLUMES 8 AND 9.  YEP, ITS BIG.  YOU WILL NEED
TO HAVE THE ENTIRE DICTIONARY IN YOUR SYSTEM IN ORDER TO USE ANY OF
THE SOFTWARE THAT USES THE DICTIONARY.  THAT COULD BE A REAL PROBLEM
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ONLY HAVE FLOPPIES, AS THE DICTIONARY ITSELF
TAKES WELL OVER A HALF MEGABYTE!  YOU MAY HAVE TO JUGGLE THINGS ON
YOUR SYSTEM DISK AS WELL.

THE OTHER FILES ARE FOR MAINTAINANCE OF THE DICTIONARY FILES THEMSELVES.

EVERYTHING IS INITIATED BY THE SPELL.EXEC FILE.  YOU KNOW, JUST TYPE
SPELL AND IT WILL PROMPT YOU FOR THE REST OF THE NECESSARY INPUTS.
THIS IS NOT PUBLIC DOMAIN.  I BOUGHT THE RIGHTS TO USE THE DICTIONARY
FOR ANY PROGRAMS WE WRITE, BUT I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN "SELL" ANY
SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDES THE DICTIONARY.  SO, TAKE CARE WITH THIS ONE.
LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE A NEED TO SHARE IT.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

YSREL.BASICOBJ

THIS IS A PROGRAM FOR CALCULATING THE RELIABILITY OF A SYSTEM
WHERE THE FAILURE RATES FOR INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS AND THEIR
EXPECTED LIFE ARE KNOWN.  IT WAS TAKEN FROM "SOME COMMON
BASIC PROGRAMS" BY LON POOLE AND MARY BORCHERS.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:


ELL, THAT'S  THE END  OF VOLUME 7.  LET ME  HEAR YOUR COMMENTS
ABOUT IT.   WE ARE  ALL STILL LEARNING AND I'M  SURE THAT THERE
WILL BE  MANY CHANGES TO COME. GIVE ME A CALL ANY TIME.
