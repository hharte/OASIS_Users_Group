Good Morning Fellow Oasis User:



VOLUME 30: contains a production control program system, produced
by Bill Quintrell  (615) 877-2716.  This system is  complete, but
has only  limited documentation.  Bill has told me that he thinks
it can  be significantly improved, but hasn't had time to work on
it.  I'd suggest contacting him, if you are thinking of using it.
This  volume also  contains a  whole new batch of QUIPs  together
with the data  encoding program Gary Bergman uses  on them.  Also
included  is a  new COPYX  command from Gary Bergman for  copying
INDEXED  or  KEYED  files either  sector by  sector  or record by
record, a new utility for typing envelops from a name and address
file in  Script format,  a utility for printing labels  3 up also
from  Gary Bergman,  a variation  of  the FILELIST command called
SHOWFILE that is  less cryptic than the Oasis  version (from John
Taylor), and a utility for rebuilding a crashed partition without
resetting the  whole computer (REBUILDP) from Albert Bates.  Lots
of goodies in this mixed bag.

VOLUME 29 MISSING: It was there!!!  But, at least 20 or 30 of you
wrote or  called to say you didn't get it.  It was on the back of
Volume 28.  The  diskette was a "flippy" with  two sets of single
side index holes.   All you have to do  is turn the disk over and
you've  got  Volume   29.   Sorry  for  the  confusion   and  any
inconvenience it may have caused.

CARAVAN: Yep!   The camels  got lost  in  the dunes or something.
Actually   what   happened   is   a   little  more   bizarre.   A
computerphobic friend of mine agreed to reset the computer once a
week for me  while I was in Asia.   Unfortunately, the very first
week the terminal came unplugged somehow.  So, week after week my
loyal friend  reset the computer and typed the startup command on
a  DEAD  terminal.  Our  information system  was  down for all of
August and part of September.  At the moment we are back up again
with   300  baud   operation  only.   Malcolm  Blackhall  at  NNC
Electronics is  in the process of writing some software that will
let us operate with both 300 and 1200 baud.  Possibly by the time
you read this it will be up in the dual mode.

PHASE ONE: Boy,  just let  me go out of town  for a few weeks and
all hell  breaks  loose.   So  many  important things  have  been
happening that  I don't know where to begin, certainly not at the
beginning!

I have been hearing  for a long time that  Phase One has not been
satisfying the  desires of  some of the more finicky  OASIS users
for technical support.  Lots of people know this, it's no secret.
One of  the people who came to this same conclusion some time ago
was Tim Williams (the same).  While Tim is still associated in an
intimate way  with Phase One and is still working on OASIS-16, he
has started  a new company called, better sit down for this one -
OASIS TECHNOLOGY.

In a very  enlightening conversation a week ago, Tim told me that
the  primary  objective  of the  new company  will  be to provide
excellent  technical  support  for  OASIS users,  even Z-80 OASIS
users!   You've  got  to  believe  he  can  do  it  now,  because
practically the entire experienced technical staff from Phase One
has left  to join  him.  When I asked him  what the new company's
relationship with  Phase  One  currently  is,  he said  "at  arms
length",  a phrase  I once  used to describe our relationship  to
them, too.

Among the  people  now  working  with  OASIS  TECHNOLOGY  are Tim
Williams, Jack  Zelver, Dave Sheffy, Sue Connellano, Andy Mender,
and  apparently  Mike  Blaisdell is  also in  some  way involved.
Being a  "new" company they are actively looking for work and can
be reached  at (415)  820-5592.  Might not be a  bad idea to give
them a call just to explore their impressive capabilities.

Setting hurt  feelings  and legal  complexities aside, this could
well be  the long wished for turning point for OASIS.  One way or
the other I suppose it will be.  With OASIS TECHNOLOGY taking the
lead  for  technical  support,  including  help  with  new system
implementations, PHASE ONE should be able to focus more attention
on  the promotion  of the  operating system itself - in  order to
sell more systems.

Some tangible  evidence is  beginning to emerge that their recent
efforts  to  get better  press coverage  is  starting to pay off.
While  we're talking  about it,  my OUG press releases have  been
picked up by at least a half dozen publications and I've gotten a
few releases from  you folks, which I am  sure were printed in at
least a few journals, too.  So, the OASIS publicity ball seems to
be rolling just a little faster than before.

Tim told  me that  he and  others have felt for a  long long time
that Phase One has been missing the boat by not making better use
of  our user's  group.  He  made it clear that he  and presumably
others at his new company will be looking for mutually beneficial
ways  to interact  with the  OUG and our members.  I  must say at
this point  that Sidorsky has apparently turned back on the green
light for some degree of OUG support.  Joel Lafette, has informed
me that  we will be allowed to place our PAID ads in the Software
Directory starting with  the next issue, and I  have been getting
an average  of one new referral per day from them since my return
on 11  September.  There are of course, lots of other more active
ways  that  we might/should  collaborate, considering that we are
all  in the  same boat.   A strong and active professional  users
group is one of the best ways I know for putting more sail on the
boat (and for bailing when that is necessary, too).

I have been  told by  Phase One insiders that they  certainly are
not  abandoning  the  8-bit version  just because  most  of their
resources are  now committed  to OASIS-16.  I think I  detected a
recognition that  the Z-80 OASIS will have a significant nitch to
fill for a very long time.

MIGRATION: Several of  our members have now told me that they are
definitely moving  toward UNIX - that they feel compelled to jump
on the  16-bit band  wagon before it gets too  far down the road.
OASIS-16 has  just been too long in coming for them.  Many of you
have suggested privately to me that Phase One may have missed the
window for the 16-bit market.  I don't think so.  It is true that
Phase  One  has not  done a  very good job in providing  reliable
estimates of availability dates.  I think that more than anything
is the problem.

The 16-bit machines have really only been around now for a little
over  a year,  hardly long  enough for the manufacturers to  have
shaken  all  of  the bugs  out  of  them.   Tim  tells me  he  is
determined  to  make  the 16-bit  version the highest performance
operating system in existence and to delay final releases only as
long as necessary to realize that objective.  He says he wants to
avoid  some  of the  technical problems  they  had with the first
releases of  the Z-80 OASIS.  There are three machine versions of
OASIS-16  now  in beta  test, at  least one of which has  already
reported back  to Phase One.  All of the evidence available to me
suggests that the waiting is about over.

But for  those  of  you  who  are  still  determined  to  protect
yourselves,  or  who would  for other  reasons  like to run their
software  under  other  operating systems,  there are now several
programs  for converting  OASIS software.  Brian Goodheim told me
about   New  Age   BASIC  which   is  purported  to  be  a   UNIX
implementation of OASIS  BASIC.  Also, I heard that  there is now
an OBASIC  to "C"  conversion program.  Beats me how  they do it,
and no  one has told me who has it.  Just today I received a call
from another  of our members, Zri Barak up in Canada, who says he
now has  an OBASIC to MBASIC translation program - the reverse of
our MCONVERT.   In the  mail today was a flyer  from Scott Bouman
(Quest Research) for a UNIX version of the SEND/RECEIVE commands.
And, we  released an  OASIS version of the CP/M  program MODEM on
Volume 6 of the library a while back.

So it  appears  that  the  the  gates  are  now  opening in  both
directions  for applications  software to  flow  both to and from
OASIS - overall a healthy development I think.

JAPAN: has  no  OASIS  users  to  speak  of  as  yet, but  that's
changing.  While  we were  there I had a chance  to talk (with my
wife's translation)  with some  of the people concerned with  the
implementation of OASIS on Japanese machines.  In addition to the
Seiko  machine  which  no  one  wanted  to  talk  about for  some
mysterious reason, there are at least four other Japanese machine
manufacturers committed  to offering OASIS: Canon, Pentel, Victor
(Sirius), and Toshiba.

Considering the growing  importance of computers from the land of
the  rising  sun, this  is looks  like  a healthy development for
OASIS.  The guy  at Pental said that they  will be introducing an
8086 machine in  the near future in addition  to the 8-bit system
they are  now starting  to market both in the  US and Japan.  But
business practices  are very different in most other countries so
that  most  of our  business oriented  software  will not be very
useful without  major modifications  - even if the displays  were
translated  into  the foreign  languages.  A market for utilities
does exist in Japan, however, and some of the manufacturers might
be interested in including copies of business software with their
machines for the American market.  We will shortly have a mailing
list for all the machine manufacturers.

HONG KONG: is  the computer/software ripoff capital of the world.
Be thankful that  no one is much interested  in OASIS there.  Our
Hong  Kong   member  was  very  helpful  in  getting  me  to  the
semi-secret  computer   discount  market.   Hidden  away  in  the
basement and second floors of a building that looked like any one
of a  thousand others,  were a hundred tiny stores  all trying to
sell both hardware  (mostly "Apples") and software at  the lowest
prices.  Apple  II+ were selling for about $200 and you could get
an Apple  IIe  for  about  $350.   The biggest  bargains  were in
software, however.  For  prices varying from about one  dollar to
about  six you  could have  your pick of just about  any American
software  package you  wanted, including  such  gems as dBASE II,
Peachtree Accounting, Supercalc, Visacalc, Wordstar, etc.

When questioned,  the  vendors  assured  me that  the copies were
legal as long  as I didn't make any  commercial use of them.  The
Hong Kong  officials don't see it that way, but seem powerless to
stop  the  practice  without  legal  pressure  from  the American
copyright  holders.  While  I was  there they made a raid  on the
area  and  confiscated  all  the  stock  of  one  store that  was
blatantly  selling  Apple  look-alikes  actually marked  with the
Apple logo.  I didn't buy anything, but I've got to tell you that
the low prices tempted me.

COMDEX: plans are beginning  to firm up.  We will  be there on 29
November.   It looks  like  we  will  have  our meetings  in  the
Regalian East  Room at the Ceasar's Palace on that date, probably
in the morning.  We are planning both a usual general meeting and
a new series of tutorials this time.  Several of our members have
volunteered  to  help  with  the  tutorials (about  four separate
sessions) and people  from OASIS TECHNOLOGY have been  invited to
participate.  If you  have any thoughts on this,  get to me soon.
More later when the plans are firmer.

WOW!   This was a long newsletter.  I guess it is a reflection of
the  three  enormous  post  office mail bags I had waiting for me
when I got back from our Asian trip.


Peace,

DANGER IN BASIC CSI COMMAND                       10 March 1983

The Oasis  Basic  manual instructions  about the  use  of the CSI
command indicate  that you can't use it to attach a device with a
class  code   driver.   What  the  manual  doesn't  say  is  that
attempting to do  so may, as it did  in one case for us, blow the
system  nucleus and  one  or  more  sectors  of the  system  disk
directory into oblivion.   This caused us to loose  several hours
of work  on a  8 Mbyted hard disk, but  could have been even more
disasterous if used on a fully operational system.

â–¼ ANT A PRINTED COPY OF THE PROGRAM INFO AS WELL? [Y/N]:N





THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAMS ON VOLUME 30.

*****************************************************************


COPYX.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND

This is  a  generalized  expand/copy program  that transfers data
from  a KEYED  or INDEXED  file to any other file  with a similar
KEYLEN  RECSIZE.  One  major feature  of this utility is that  it
pulls data  from the input file on a "SECTOR" basis, which speeds
up  the  process  and  guarantees  to  extract  all INDEXED  file
records.  It  waq  developed  in  the  process of  improving  the
performance of Bob Chapman's spelling checker (PRUFEDIT).

One of  the changes  I made,  allows the use of KEYED  or INDEXED
files.   The  actual  modifications  to  "PRUFEDIT"  were  mailed
directly to Bob.

From Gary Bergman (201) 246-7285

NCODE.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND

This utility "encodes"  a sequential file by scrambling each byte
according  to a  specific alogrithim.   This  is the same program
that was used  to "encode" the data for  the "QUIP" system.  From
Gary Bergman (201) 246-7285

NVELOPS.EXEC/SCRIPT

This is a routine I wrote to print labels from the various
mailing  lists  (eg. MEMBERS.ADDRESS and EDITORS.ADDRESS).
It asks for the name of the mailing list and the runs  the
SCRIPT file ENVELOPS.SCRIPT. It's not fancy at all, but it
is the one I use all the time as of right now.  FB

Syntax:    ENVELOPS  [<fn> <ft>]|[HELP]

Note:      No punctuation used between file name and type.

ABEL3A.SCRIPT


Is a  SCRIPT file  for printing  3 across labels.  It prints  one
label per record (3 records at a time).  Most of the time I print
duplicate sets at once, with a simpler file.  This file is used
when only  1 label per record is needed.  There are other ways of
accomplishing this, but I thought I would just pass this along to
you.    Gary Bergman (201) 246-7285

To use this you must first ASSIGN channel 3 to the mailing list
file (eg >ASSIGN 3 MEMBERS ADDRESS S).  FB

SGS.EXEC

This  is  a  program  first released on volume 23.  Bill Symonds,
after a lot of frustration, discovered several bugs in  it  which
have  been corrected in this re-release. (Note: this EXEC must be
used in conjunction with the other MSGS* programs on volume 23. )
You should just copy it over  to  volume  23 before trying to run
the MSGS system.

CP.DOC/EXEC
PCPACK/PCPADD/PCPINIT1/PCPINIT2/PCPINIT3/PCPINVNT.BASIC
PCPINVNT.INDEXED
PCPJOBS.INDEXED
PCPMENU.BASIC
PCPPRINT.WORK
PCPSRIAL.BASIC/INDEXED

This is  a full  production control program/system (PCP).  It was
developed  by  Bill  Quintrell of  PERSONALIZED BUSINESS SYSTEMS,
  Mountain  Creek   Rd  #1409,Chattanooga,  TN  37415  (615)
-2716.  He would like to do something with it commercially, so
this is an  end-user-only copy (as with most  OUG library items).
The  documentation is  skimpy and  there are a few places  in the
code  where  improvements could  be made.   With  these things in
mind, you  will still  find PCP is a complete,  fully functional,
ready to run system.  If you make any improvements to it for your
own use, please let both Bill and me know.  FB

UIP1.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND/DATA/RECORD

The QUIP  program originally  released on volume 22 was slighltly
modified  to  work  with QUIP1.DATA  and a  new  set of QUIPS was
prepared  for  this contribution.   The new  quips  came from the
students of  UCSB who have been contributing them over the years.

EBUILDP.EXEC

This is time  saving utility  for fixing crashed partitions in  a
multi-user  system without  reseting the entire system.  You will
need to  make some  changes to this EXEC for  your own system, no
doubt,  but  look  it  over  and  see  what  you  think.  It  was
contributed by Albert Bates of Plenty.  (615) 964-3992.

HOFILE.EXEC
SHOWFILE.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND
SHOWFMCK.COPY
SHOWFUNP.COPY

The OASIS  "FILELIST"  command  does not  show the  key  size for
Indexed  and Keyed  files.  In  addition, some of the other  file
parameters  are  encoded  in  a  rather  cryptic  fashion.  These
limitations are imposed by the requirement that each file's entry
fit on a single line.

The "SHOWFILE"   utility   was   written   to  circumvent   these
limitations.  It  displays a file's format information (including
key length and percentage of records in use for Keyed and Indexed
files) in a  more readable format.  Since the  display fills most
of  the   screen,  this  utility  allows  only  a  single  file's
parameters to  be displayed at one time--no wildcards are allowed
in the file  specification.  The utility will work  with any file
format.
â–¼ ^
This program uses  two routines  which may be of use  to assembly
language  programmers.  "SHOWLMCK.COPY"  is used at the beginning
of  an OASIS  program.  It  tests to see whether there  is enough
memory to  run the program.  It also tests to see if the user has
requested  "HELP"  and displays  the help message if appropriate.
"SHOWLUNP.COPY"  will  unpack the  date and  time  from the OASIS
packed format.  It has the reverse effect of SC 46 ("PACK").

ELL, THAT'S  THE END  OF VOLUME 30.  LET ME  HEAR YOUR COMMENTS
ABOUT IT.   WE ARE  ALL STILL LEARNING AND I'M  SURE THAT THERE
WILL BE  MANY CHANGES TO COME. GIVE ME A CALL ANY TIME.
