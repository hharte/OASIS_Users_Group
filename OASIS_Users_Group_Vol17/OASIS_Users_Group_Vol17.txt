27 October 1982         N E W S   L E T T E R           Volume 17
-----------------------------------------------------------------




Dear Member;

Every time I  finish putting one of these together I have roughly
the  same  feelings: WOW,  is it  already volume XX; and BOY,  we
really  got  some  good  stuff  this  time!!!   Volume  17 is  no
exception.   Sometimes  I  can't believe  the really high quality
programs  people are  willing  to  share  with  the rest  of  the
members.  I know both from studying the code and talking with the
authors that a  lot of love, sweat and  tears go into many of the
things we have in our unbelievably 800+ file library.

Volume 17 is special in a couple of ways.  First, it contains the
first  "example"  of  a commercial  program product demo package,
PDQ, a  data base  management system.  The author, John  Lapenta,
has contributed  several modules  of the complete package to  the
OUG library.  These  stand alone and are usable  without the rest
of  the  system.   Several  commercial  software developers  have
promised to send demo packages, but this is the first one.  There
is  nothing  sacred about  the content,  form,  or format of this
first  example.   My  plan  is  to  start  a  separate series  of
demonstration disks that would not be a part of the basic library
- except for  those parts contributed to the  OUG by the software
developer.   We  would  announce  the  availability  of  new demo
packages as  they became available in the newsletters.  So, those
of you  who have  been waiting for someone else  to be the first,
now is the  time for you to get  that demo disk finished and sent
in.

Second, this is the first volume to contain a "dangerous" utility
for  fooling  around  with the  OASIS system programs themselves.
With the  new SETPRIV command you can set your personal privilege
level  to any  value  between  zero  and  255!  This  is  not for
beginners!   (see  notes  in  SOURCE.CODE  file in  this volume).
There will be  many more utilities along this  line in the future
if promises  from other  members are even close to  "for real." I
URGE  EVERYONE  TO USE  THESE NEW  CAPABILITIES  ONLY FOR ETHICAL
PURPOSES!!!!!  If members  were to use them for  any purpose that
hurt Phase One Systems in some way, we might find it a lot harder
to get them to support our efforts in the future.  Please keep it
in mind when you play around with these powerful new utilities.

Several of the  other programs  in volume 17 are winners  too.  I
like WAKEUP which  allows me to use my  computer to automatically
ring the phones  of all my friends at  7 AM to let them know they
ought to be up enjoying the beautiful morning instead of sleeping
like me.

The BUSINESSMASTER  project  is  not  dead, it  is only sleeping.
But, we now  have a new member of  the team who has agreed to try
and pull  it all together.  Some of the team members have told me
they are making progress.  So, keep the faith, baby.

The bulletin board system also is not dead.  I hope to have it up
and  running right  after the  COMDEX meeting.  There is a  phone
number  already  assigned:  (805)  965-5415.  Initially,  it will
operate at  300 baud  and should be available about  December 10,
1982 (almost exactly a year after our original target).

COMDEX. We will  be there with both a meeting at the Hilton and a
hospitality suite  at the Tropicana.  The meeting will be held at
10:00  AM  on Thursday,  December 2  in Conference Room 9 at  the
Hilton  Hotel (that's  the only  time we could get a  room).  The
hospitality  suite will  be in  Room 2002 at the Tropicana  Hotel
Tower  between  noon  Tuesday,  November  30  and  noon Thursday,
December 2.   I'll be there a lot of the time to talk with people
and to  demonstrate things  in the library.  Both evenings  there
will probably  be someone around most of the time.  It's right on
the strip, so plan to drop by.

We still need  more people  to write review articles about  OASIS
for the  many computer journals.  A few members have told me they
are  or have  sent things  in for publication, but we  need many,
many more  people  to  start  letting  the world  know  about the
virtues of OASIS and the commercial software now available to run
under it.

Several of  you  have  now told  me you  have  TRS-80 programs to
convert to  OASIS BASIC and both a GETFILE capability and program
like  MCONVERT  that  will work  with the  Radio  Shack programs.
There must be  someone out there who either  has done it or knows
how to do it.

Volume 18 or 19  will contain a new and  MUCH improved version of
the spelling  checker - at least twice as fast and innovative new
features.  Also, Phase One is donating all of the source code for
the currently available  device drivers (class codes) and  all of
the current patches for known glitches in the various versions of
OASIS.  The  first true  diskette compress utility is also  ready
for release.  The press release system is also about ready.

Just a note  of apology to all you authors, who after burning the
midnight oil to get your masterpiece JUST RIGHT, find that I have
gone and  mucked around with it.  I'm afraid I just can't control
my urge  to  make most  of the  things  you submit just a  little
better or easier to understand.  I'm sure some of you must feel a
little  urked  to see  some of  the  wholesale modifications that
often get  made to perfectly good programs - usually at the front
end in the form of EXEC's to tie everything all together.

When I get a  new package, the first thing  I do is try to run it
as it  was submitted.   If anything causes me to  stumble or feel
confused about how  to proceed, or if I  think a less experienced
member might falter, I'm very inclined to make a change.  In some
cases, I even ask the author to make major changes before putting
something in  the library.   If you are one of  the authors whose
work has been  mangled in this way, please  forgive.  In adding a
little polish to your work, I'm just thinking about the most good
for the most people (is that bad English?).

Finally we have made arrangements to get the library converted to
ONYX tapes and BILLINGS minidiskettes again.  These are now being
delivered.   Arrangements are  also in progress for Northstar and
Vector formats, but I haven't seen the converted versions yet.

Well that's it  for volume  17.  A really good one  by almost any
standard.  Hope you are putting the finishing touches on that gem
you promised to send in a year ago.  (gotcha didn't I)


Peace,


Fred Bellomy

Dear Fred,

It may be  a modest effort but at least I'm trying.  On this disk
you will  find a small contribution to the OUG library: a program
that  will  turn your  computer into  an alarm clock.  It may  be
superfluous  and  you  may not  consider it  even  good enough to
include but it does work and I offer it as a token.

I have made  some  effort  to  thoroughly  debug it  and  provide
sufficient error traps  and remarks to ensure its  portability; I
think you will find it correct in that respect.

The EXEC  programs  are necessary  to do the appropriate ATTACHes
(not possible in  BASIC) and the printer echo  toggle (I couldn't
find a way  to do that in BASIC  either).  In any case, feel free
to muck around with it as you please.

I am also including a couple of previously issued programs that I
thought needed some  improvement.  They're very good and  I don't
mean to cast  any aspersions on their authors  but I believe they
are   better   now.   The   first,  ADDRESS2,  while  offering  a
substantial improvement over its previous incarnation as ADDRESS,
still  suffered  from  a faulty  CASE -  CEND  construction which
allowed  improper  exiting  from  the  loop.   Depending  on your
system, a printout  of a data file while  run out of memory after
about 350 iterations due to the non-clearing of the SELECT stack.

After much frustration in  trying to print a file  of 2000 names,
calls to Mr Trimble, Phase One, etc., there it was on page 100 of
the BASIC manual.  I notice that although the latest contribution
of Mr  Trimble carefully avoids this error no one has pointed out
the problem  in the above-mentioned program.  At the same time, I
must confess  that I  seem to have created a  bug in my effort to
make the  program suitable for both Canadian and U.S.  addresses.
In  the U.S.   the city,  state and ZIP code are  all on the same
line.  However,  in Canada the Postal Code is required to be on a
separate   line.    My  added   routine  performs  this  checking
correctly, treating the two types of address accordingly, but the
subsequent  variables   (phone  nos.,  refcodes)  are  improperly
positioned when  the file is printed.  So far I haven't been able
to figure it out.

GRAPHNET works fine  but I  thought a utility of OASIS  which has
obvious  application  here  was  being  ignored: the  translation
capability  of the  COPYFILE command.   Since  telex and twx (and
Graphic  Scanning  Corp.)  all  require uppercase  only it seemed
appropriate  to   me  to  temporarily  convert  the  file  to  be
transmitted  (it gets  erased even  before  the formatted file is
sent).

SPELLCHEK on the  other hand,  doesn't work fine (what do  I want
for  the  price?).   It  can't  handle  text  generated by  Magic
Wand(tm) as that  program creates records exceeding the  limit of
OASIS BASIC.   Any text beyond the string limit doesn't get read.
I  am also  amazed  at  the  number  of misspelled  words  in the
dictionary  (to  say   nothing  of  some  of  the   more  bizarre
inclusions).   While I'm  on the  subject, it looks like you  are
starting to  use it yourself; there was a distinct improvement in
spelling in your editorial on the latest volume.

I don't mean to give offense; it's just that I feel that literacy
is  losing ground  in today's  world and it sometimes seems  that
computer enthusiasts  are at the head of this downward turn.  The
spelling  and  grammar  I encounter  on the  BBS's  is frequently
appalling.  The  medium doesn't offer any encouragement itself so
it seems to me that it behooves us to make special effort to keep
our  standards  up.   I for  one, at  any  rate, appreciate those
efforts.

But wait  a moment,  what's this?   No sooner have I sat  down to
write  this, my  first machine-readable  letter  to you, than the
mailman  hands  me Vol.13  and 14!   And what do I find?   Fellow
Canadian  Bob  Chapman's  new  improved PRUFEDIT!   This one WILL
handle Magic Wand text (by simply augmenting the input and output
record  buffers to  whatever size  you need [how long can  you go
without entering  a carriage return?])!  Bravo, Bob, this kind of
thing  is helping  the  UG  move  into  a whole  new  standard of
software (wish I could say the same for my own effort).

By the way, some time ago someone suggested CARAVAN as a name for
the  OUG.   Although you've  obviously had  a  pile of stationery
printed with  the  latter  name  is  there any  possibility  of a
change?  I thought the suggestion most imaginative.

MCONVERT is a great  idea and although it doesn't  work perfectly
we were all  clearly warned about its rough  condition.  I'd like
to  offer  some  refinements to  it but  I'm  afraid I don't know
Microsoft  Basic  well enough  (or OASIS  BASIC  either, for that
matter) to  do so.   I can report, however, that  there are flaws
which  did  surprise  me; I  can probably  figure  out what to do
eventually but  I'll mention  one to you in the  expectation that
you will fix  it in 30 seconds: the  multiple statement separator
in MBASIC (:) doesn't get consistently changed to by the program.
It doesn't seem  to handle multiple occurrences of  the character
(which  is  odd since  that's how  it's  used).  Anyway, improved
versions  of this  and others  like it will certainly be  greeted
with great cheers.

Another by-the-way: for your records, I am operating OASIS 5.5 on
an ACS8000-7, (Altos)  with a TeleVideo 920C, the  29Mb hard disk
and a NEC Spinwriter 5510.

Problem department: According  to the System Manual (Appendix G),
the  TeleVideo  CRT  doesn't have  an "EU"  function  whereas the
TeleVideo manual  clearly says it does.  I am including a copy of
CLASS41 ASSEMBLE which  is a driver to be  used by Magic Wand but
neither with  Class Code 7 nor 41 "ATTACH"ment does this function
work for me.  The function isn't ignored; rather it responds with
a  "CLEAR",   wiping  everything.    This  is  why  I  added   an
"ERASE.UNPROT"  subroutine  in  Trimble's ADDRESS2  program - his
"PRINT  CRT$("EU")  wouldn't work.   It will  work  in local mode
("Block" mode) so  I know the terminal has  the capability but so
far I have  not been able to write  a driver that will enable the
software to  make use of it.  Can you or one of the members help?
There must be plenty of other TeleVideo owners in the OUG.    The
source for CLASS41.ASSEMBLE is reproduced below:

WISH LIST #17 - I wish somebody would...................................
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

1. We need  a general purpose BASIC converter - you know, from any other
BASIC (like BASIC-E)  to OASIS BASIC.  (NOTE: We  now have MCONVERT, but
it needs more work.  I think it can be used as the basis for programs to
convert other dialects with modification)


3. We need  to  develop  a cheap  way for  members  to call the new  OUG
Bulletin Board computer.  Does anyone know a way to use the networks (ie
TELENET,  TYMNET,  etc.) or  other phone  service  for cheap "off hours"
communications?

6. We need  a conversion  routine for converting ASSEMBLY language  code
from other Z80 systems to OASIS.

7. We need a BASIC disassembler.

8. I need  a comprehensive mailing list program for keeping track of all
our members  - one  that we can put in  the OUG library.  Thanks for all
the  contributions on  this on.   Still don't have what I  want yet.  It
needs to operate with SCRIPT as well.

9. I  need a  data base  system for maintaining the commercial  software
directory - again one that can be released into the OUG library.

10. We need  people who  can begin doing benchmark tests  of the various
software  products that  are becoming  available  - both proprietary and
public domain.

11. We need  lots more  applications to run against the  dictionary data
base.


13. WE BADLY NEED  A MODIFICATION TO SYSTEM.NUCLEUS THAT  WILL IMPLEMENT
THE BREAK  FUNCTION.  PHASE ONE hasn't been responsive to the pleas from
(at least) several members.  This may be hardware dependent.

14. We  need someone  to run  our dictionary through one or  more of the
other spelling checkers.  There are MANY misspelled words in the current
version of our word list, as well as many more non-words.

15. We need a systematic way to keep track of the CLASS Codes and Device
drivers -  like  an  alphabetical  list  by device  names  with names of
drivers.

16. Boy do we need an "electronic spreadsheet" like VISACALC!


18. We need a GETFILE capability for use with TRS-80 disk files.

19. We very  much need a comparison of the features of the various major
operating systems (including OASIS, naturally).

20. We need  a  system  for  recording  and displaying  the  features of
commercial  software packages  - one  that I could send to  the software
developers for them to "fill out themselves."

21. Someone to  stay on top of all the new bulletin boards coming on the
air and to  give us an update of  the phone numbers and purpose of each,
etc.

22. A  screen  oriented  editer (like  Magic Wand  or  Spellbinder) - an
admittedly big task,  but probably doable even in  BASIC for anyone with
the ambition.

23. A  spelling  checker that  keeps track  of the words I misspell  and
automatically corrects them for me without making me look up the correct
spelling again and again and again each time.

24. A synchronous communication program.

25. People to search through other users groups libraries for worthwhile
things to  convert for operation under OASIS which we do not yet have in
the OUG library.

26. Compilers for "C", Pascal, Fortran, PL/1, Cobol, etc.

SUBJECT: SOURCE CODE AVAILABILITY



I am often  asked about  the type of program forms  that are
acceptable  for  inclusion in  the OUG Library.  Some people
prefer  COMPILED  versions,  while  others want  OBJECT, and
still others  want SOURCE.  In the beginning I put all three
versions in  the library  for BASIC programs.  It took  up a
lot of space  to do it, but it  seemed like the safest thing
to do at  the time.  Some people wanted  the ASCII source so
that they  could change  things using the EDITOR because  of
memory  limitations  which  would  not  allow them  to bring
OBJECT  code into  the interpreter for editing.  Some people
wanted the  COMPILED versions to save themselves the trouble
of compiling  every new BASIC program that arrived.  But, we
soon  discovered  that  BASIC  programs  compiled under  one
release  of  OASIS  often would  not run  under  a different
release (eg 5.4  and 5.5).  So, they needed  the OBJECT code
to get a compiled version that would work in their system.

There was no  one  solution  that  would  solve all  of  the
problems  and  make everyone  equally happy.  The compromise
plan, I  think, goes a long way to making everything easiest
for everyone.   We now  only put BASIC source code  programs
into  the  library and  provide a  variety  of utilities for
converting  them  to  OBJECT and  COMPILED versions.  In the
case  of  ASSEMBLY programs,  the same thing applies, except
that we  may  well  include  both  the source  code  and the
assembled  COMMAND.   Unlike  BASIC  programs  the  assembly
version cannot  be executed in it's original form.  The same
reasoning  will  apply  to  COBOL,  "C", or  other  language
programs when they start to appear in the library.

Another aspect  is software  protection.  Some people submit
things  for  which they  have commercial  plans.   This is a
little  more complicated.   Everything in the library is now
copyrighted, either by the authors themselves or by the OUG.
This does provide  some legal protection, but does  not stop
an unscrupulous individual from stealing the ideas for their
own commercial  gain.  Releasing only COMPILED versions into
the library  makes it more difficult for anyone to see how a
program was put  together.  It does not make  it impossible,
however.  There  are several very good decompilers out there
now -  in  fact  several  of  our members  have  promised to
contribute  their's  to  the  OUG  library.   Anyone  who is
determined enough  to steal software can find a way.  So, we
have  to  do  a  lot  of  trusting  -  accept an  occasional
undetected BAD  GUY, and let the ones we discover know in no
uncertain  terms   that  depriving  someone  else  of  their
rightful profit will not be tolerated.

With all of  this in  mind, I will continue to  maintain the
policy  of  including  SOURCE code  versions of all programs
added to the  library - with a very  few special exceptions.
The  special exceptions  generally will deal with current or
planned  future   commercial  exploitation  of  the  program
submitted to  the  library  for  use  by OASIS  USERS  GROUP
members on a non-commercial basis.

I will not withhold SOURCE because it is too complicated for
most members to understand, because they might misuse it for
illegal or  unethical purposes, or because they might change
it in some  way that could cause harm  to some part of their
system.

We have some very sophisticated software people in our group
and I  want to  encourage them to muck around  with anything
they  find in  the library  in any way they can  think of to
create some new capability.  If we protect the neophytes too
well we will deprive others of important opportunities.

Some software  utilities  give  the user  capabilities never
intended   or   even  invisioned   by  the  original  system
developers (eg Tim  Williams et.  al.).  It is  possible for
someone to defeat all of the safeguards against unauthorized
redistribution of  copies the OASIS System (eg serial number
removal/changes).    I   do   not  condone   such  unethical
activities.  I do know that many of our members have created
such  capabilities and  are using them for perfectly ethical
purposes.  Such  utilities are like a knife.  In the hands of
a murderer  it can  kill, in the hands of  a sculptor it can
create  art.   Like the  knife, such utilities in themselves
are neither  good nor bad.  If I can conceive of any good to
which  a new  utility  can  be  put,  I will  add  it to the
library.  I  don't intend  to stretch this policy to  absurd
limits,  though.   Thus, the  serial number changing utility
will  not   be  included.   That  is  a  capability  rightly
restricted  to  organizations  authorized  by  Phase One  to
distribute copies  of OASIS.  But, there wont be many things
that I'll have to exclude.  So, send them in.

Finally, changing  the code  in many programs can have quite
disasterous consequences.   If someone who doesn't know what
they  are  doing  starts fooling  around with programs, they
might  indeed  cause serious  damage to  some  part of their
system.  We have  such people among our members.   In fact,
every time  I  put  something new  into the  library  I think
particularly about them  and how they are going  to normally
react to the  new program.  I try to  insure that the USE of
anything in  our library is fairly GOOF PROOF.  That doesn't
extend to programs modified by a member.  How could it?  Any
time you  change the code in a program you do so at your own
risk.  Everyone knows that.  Don't they?

If I have belabored  this subject, please excuse me.   I get
so many questions/arguments from people that I just decided
it was time to speak my mind.  If you disagree with anything
I've said,  go ahead and let me know.  I do really listen to
good arguments.   And I don't mind small fights, as long as
there is no  blood involved!  - and we  shake hands and make
up before we finish.

Peace,

ADDRESS2.BASIC

David Skulski up in Canada made some changes to Joe Trimble's
program to make it more compatible with the postal requirements
of his country and fixes a CASE-CEND error he found.  He does
confess to having introduced a new output format error for the
extra data fields.

PDQ is a full database management system with screen generators,
file builders, report generators, and more.  Some of the programs
have been added to the OUG library for all members to use at once.
The full system is a commercial proprietary product and is for
sale by the developer, FST.  Included here is a description of the
complete system, a description of just that portion which John
Lapenta contributed to the OUG library, an automated demo of the
file maintenance portion, and the several file maintenance modules
which he contributed.  Because it is proprietary, no source code is given.

Setting high privilege levels allows some really weird things to

STRATING.BASIC/INDEXED

This is an excellant Startrek game that we have been playing for
about 5 years. It was obtained from the users library offered by BTI
(Basic timesharing, Inc.) and we have modified it for OASIS. The
original game was one program, but we have broken it down to run on
smaller systems.  STARTREK and STCOMPUT are the programs that actually
operate the game. STRATING is a program that tells you if you have
won or lost and keeps a record of the high score achieved and average
scores for other players. STRATING.INDEXED is the file where the
scores are stored for use by the STRATING program. There have never
been very many instructions for this program, but if anyone is
interested have them contact us and we will try to write some out
and mail them. We learned by just playing it over and over.
