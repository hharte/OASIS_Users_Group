Welcome  to  Introductory Volume 2 of a  very  rapidly expanding
library of OASIS compatible member contributed "END-USER-ONLY"
software.

This volume contains brief descriptions of the contents of the
first 30 OUG library volumes. You might want to give some thought
to printing out a hard copy of some of this stuff.  But, be
warned that the printed version is nearly an inch thick!

The following is a listing of the files on this INTRO2 disk.

ACRS.BASIC

This program  computes  depreciation  schedules based  on the new
1981  tax  laws.  It  is very  useful for real estate people  and
personal investment decision analysis.  The program allows you to
enter headings and  names of customers and agents  if you want to
print  the  schedule out  for someone.   This  was adapted from a
program  and  article that  appeared in  the  March 1982 issue of
Interface Age.  It was submitted by Tom and Carolyn Cannon.

DISKFILE.LIBRARY

This is a system  for keeping track of the  contents of a library
of disk(ette)s.  With it you can ADD (and delete) the contents of
any  diskette  residing on  any drive.   You  can also remove all
references to  any named disk(ette).  The FIND program is used to
find the  location of any file or class of files in your library.
We are using  the system to keep track  of the Oasis Users' Group
library contents as it grows.  The information about the files in
the library are maintained in a file called DISKFILE.LIBRARY.  It
is important that  you be aware of the  possibility of confusion,
if you  maintain more  than one copy of DISKFILE.LIBRARY  in your
system.

It was contributed  to the library by its author, Joe Trimble.  I
am sure you  will find it to be  one of the more useful utilities
in our collection.  FB

I can't  say  "yet  another mailing  list program"  for  this new
contribution from  Joe Trimble.   This is a really excellent  new
version  of  ADDRESS originally  included on  Volume  7.  Try it,
you'll like it.  Joe even included a routine, OLD2NEW, to convert
any files  you might  have created under the previous  version of
his program.  This  is an excellent example of  how to update any
program you might have submitted to the library.

David Skulski  up in  Canada made  some  changes to Joe Trimble's

This is the program  to add about 3000 new  words to your copy of
the dictionary  used with  SPELCHEK.  To use it you  must have at
least 28  blocks of available space on you system disk and have a
copy of  the dictionary  sections available in your system.   You
must   also   have   a  copy   of  the   word   sorting  program,
SPELSRTI.BASIC, available in your system, too.  The new words are
contained in the file SPELLING.ADDWORDS included on Volume 10.

ADV290.EXEC

Automatically runs  the  "ADVENTUR"  game  from the  OASIS USER'S
GROUP - VOL1.

This EXEC  was  developed  from  "user  experience", and  may not
necessarily  contain  the  most efficient,  or correct, method of
solving  the game.   In fact,  it could have been shorter,  but I
wanted  to  make sure  that every  location  was visited at least
once.

You may specify how  much of a "head-start" you  would like.  The
entire EXEC  deposits all "treasures" in the building, giving you
a SCORE  of 290  points.  You will still be  in the cave just one
move away from the final obstacle.

The only trouble is, that I haven't yet learned how to solve this
one.  If someone out there knows, please give me a call.

The EXEC allows you to select the point at which you want to take
over from the automatic play.  Good Luck !!!

NOTICE THAT THE DIMENSIONING STATEMENTS ALLOW FOR A 25 BY 25 CELL
MAZE.   NO DOUBT  SOME OF  YOU WILL NOT HAVE ENOUGH  MEMORY TO DO
THIS.   IT   IS  'IMPRESSIVE'  TO  GENERATE  COMPUTERIZED  MAZES;
HOWEVER,  AFTER HAVING  DONE A  FEW IN BASIC, IT BECOMES  OBVIOUS
THAT THEY TAKE MORE TIME TO GENERATE THAN TO SOLVE.  PERHAPS THEY
SERVE BEST AS PACIFIERS FOR 'COMPUTER WIDOWS' AND CHILDREN.

ANIMAL.BASIC/GAME

This is a classic  animal guessing game that learns  as you guess
new animals not currently in the data base.  It starts off with a
handful  of animals  and questions  to  distinguish them from one
another.  It asks  a series of questions (originally  supplied by
previous  players) until  it either  knows  the animal or guesses
wrong and  gives you  a chance to teach it  about another animal.
Kids  will  probably get  a kick  out of this one.  The  original
author  is  unknown,  although it  did come  out  of a collection
written for DEC.  Our M.  H.  Edwards converted it for OASIS.

This program tests  you on  your knowledge of english words  that

The list of words is limited and the related words are not always
precise and many  obvious words are missing.  But,  it is still a
good  learning  tool for  those who  need it.  The author is  not

This is a dandy new utility by Ron Brubaker which just prints out

you need one  every now and then and  have to search all over the

BAGELS.BASIC

My (Zoso's) review of  the software on another disk  indicated my
fondness for that  version of this game.  The  same applies here.
You've  seen it  one hundred  times, but this is probably  better
than what you've seen before.  An excellent variant of a shopworn
idea.   An  earlier release  (also called  BAGELS)  was a 4 digit
game; this is  only a 3 digit game,  but is structured so that it
is more  challenging (in  general).  A winner, but try  the other
'BAGELS' also.  (Converted for oasis by FB)

BASEBALL.BASIC

What can you  say  about a  game that  makes  you sit still at  a
computer terminal to play an action game like baseball?  I'm sure
those of  you who  find themselves glued to the  boob-toob during
baseball  season will  welcome this equally inane substitute.  It
is one  way to bridge the generation gap.  The jargon is all here
and,  if  mastered, will  make you  look like a real pro  to your
twelve year  old kid.  It's included here mostly for the baseball
widows, who think a "fly ball" is a dance for insects.

The original version of this program was written by Joel Lind and
Ken Berkman in 1973.  It has been revised several times; the last
time by me for OASIS.  FB

BASIC.EXEC
OBJBASIC.BASIC

I created this  pair of programs for those diehards out there who
still insist on having all of their BASIC programs as BASICOBJ's.
BASIC.EXEC is  a procedure that makes a list of the files of type
BASIC on  the input disk specified utilizing the command FILELIST
*.BASIC:A (FILE  where  A  is  a  variable in  the  EXEC routine.
BASIC.EXEC  then calls  the BASIC  program  OBJBASIC which I have
supplied as a BASIC file (I try to please).  OBJBASIC then writes
another EXEC  procedure which will execute the BASIC interpreter,
load each file  that was previously listed, and  resaves the file
as a  BASICOBJ type file on the specified output disk drive.  The
original EXEC then calls this new EXEC and does the job.  Finally
the damn thing cleans up after itself.  I'd almost bet that there
is an easier way to do this but this works (slowly).

This is the  same "DUMB"  program that was distributed on  VOL22.
One very important  item that was not mentioned  before, was that
it is not really that "dumb".

If you  have a  "Multi-User" system,  this  command lets you call
attention to another "user" without "disturbing" their console.

     Syntax: BELLS [nn]

     Where: nn is the partition number to be alerted.

BENCH.EXEC BENCH1/BENCH11/BENCH2/BENCH22.BASIC

This package of benchmark programs was originally released on OUG
Volume 12.  There have been some minor "cosmetic" changes made to
the BASIC  programs and significant changes made to the EXEC.  It
now includes  a table of values reported by a few of our members.
We need lots more inputs.

BIOPRINT.BASIC

Biorhythm programs for one or two people are "old hat" to most of
us by now.   Not only is the theory  fully discredited, but we've
seen  so many  of them  now that it's getting boring.   These are
some new  versions of  programs previously released on volumes  2
and 13.   Henry Alyard  used them to demonstrate how  you can use
his new  GENMENU utility.   These versions are quite elegant  and
can serve  as models  for future programs written in  BASIC which
require  selection  of  multiple options.   I am  excited  by the
possibilities which this new capability opens for our members who
want to write really professional looking programs.  I may try to
use  this capability  at  some  point  in  the future  for  a new
approach to  introducing each new volume.  I hope some of you are
motivated  to  rewrite  other  previously  released  OUG  library
programs using this fancy new capability.  FB

Note that these programs must be compiled before they will run as
the  control  program,  BIOMENU,  CHAINs  out  to  the two  other
programs,  BIOMATE  and  BIOPRINT.  The  BIOM.EXEC is included to
make the compilations semi-automatic, if needed.

CALC.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND
MATH.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND
NUM.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND
TOTAL.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND

Assembly language  math subroutines  and related applications and
demonstrations.   As the  saying goes: Write critical routines in
assembler and  comedy routines in BASIC.  Any serious programming
development   done   in  assembler   will  require  some  "basic"
mathematic   subroutines.   The   most  difficult  of  these  are
mutliplication  and  division.  OASIS  provides SC 38 39, however
they only work on 2 byte values (also a restriction in "C").

These subroutines provide 4-byte precision, which is adequate for
most business oriented applications (numbers up to 42,949,672.95)

MATH ASSEMBLE / OBJECT

Is a  collection  of  subroutines for  4-byte fixed point intiger
arithmetic.

Contains the following entry points:

NUM ASSEMBLE / COMMAND

Is a simple demonstration of how the MATH subroutines behave when
invoked from an assembler application program.  It accepts values
to  be passed  to the  various MATH subroutines and displays  the
resulting values and "flag" status.


TOTAL ASSEMBLE / COMMAND

Is a   crude,  but   somewhat  useful,  program  that  reads  any
sequential file (or device).  It scans each record looking for an
ASCII decimal  value.  The "total" is displayed at End-of-File or
ESC-C.

CALC ASSEMBLE / COMMAND

Is a full-blown  calculator program that lets your fingers do the
walking.

Some user friendly features:
     . Direct cursor addressing
     . Multiply or divide (with subtotal)
     . Running totals
     . Repetative entry (+ or -)
     . Clear key (back off previous entry)
     . Multi-column printer option
     . Help display

It only  takes  a  few  minutes  of  experimenting  to learn  its
personality.  (Now,  if  I  could  carry  my computer  in  my hip
pocket...)

CH.BASIC

CHase is  a new  version of  a game previously released on  vol 1
called CHASE.   In it  you try to get the  robots before they get
you.  This  is a  completely new, somewhat more complex  version,
but it's not finished.  I've stopped working on it, because BASIC
is TOO  SLOW, ( when ever I've got nothing to do (hah!), I'll try
to finish the  version I've started writing in  C).  CH is public
domain.

Rules for CHase:

First, put  your  terminal  in  Reverse  Video, if  your terminal
doesn't print "FON"ed characters in half intensity, your going to
have to modify the program, but most that I've seen do.

Enter the difficulty  you wish.  The lower the number the harder.
Try 10 your  first time.  When the program  asks for CW, it wants
to know  what character  you want to use to  rotate your "turret"
clock-wise, surprisingly  enough, when it asks "CC?" it wants the
character  that  will  turn  the "turret"  counter clockwise, and
"FIRE?" is  the key  that will fire thine pistol.   I use the key
group "Q,  W, E" with Q E rotating and W firing.  You may want to
use, Q W and the RETURN key or SPACE bar.  Scott Watson.

Put some logs  in the fireplace; get some hot mulled wine; a copy
of  the  latest Play(boy/girl)  magazine; and  settle  down for a
long, looooooong  game.  Randykoff (as I call the computer logic)
plays a legal  game, but takes as much  as 10 minutes to make his
move each  time.  I'm  sure there must be a  more efficient chess
program out  there in  OASIS-land somewhere.  He doesn't seem  to
remember  from  one move  to the  next what he learned about  the
possibilities during  his analysis of the previous move.  And, he
doesn't seem to  look ahead very many moves,  but I must admit to
not spending very much time studying the program's logic.

The program was  written originally  by Randy Miller in 1976  and
modified for OASIS by me in 1981.  FB

If you have  ever spent 20 minutes trying to figure out what tiny
little,  inconsequential  change  you made  to your BASIC program
last week  that now  is causing trouble, this new  utility is for
you.  It  checks two  programs (or any sequential files)  line by
line and displays mis-matches.  As soon as it finds an extra line
in either program,  all subsequent pairs of lines  are flagged as
mis-matches.  I  wish it had a little more intelligence and could
handle the extra line problem, but it still is a valuable utility
as  it  is.   It was  submitted by  its  author, Gary Thompson of
Design Systems.   I have made minor changes in the NOTES file and
added the COMPARE$.EXEC.  FB

COMPILE.EXEC

The BASIC programs on this disk were compiled under OASIS VERSION
5.4B If  you have a later or earlier version on your system, they
may not  run properly.  This utility makes it simple to recompile
programs  using  your  version of  the compiler.   My  plan is to
include only object programs at some point in the future and rely
on each  member to compile a copy for their particular system.  I
need a  little more time to think out the pros and cons of such a
move.  If  you have some thoughts on the matter, let me hear from
you.  I have changed the overview execs (eg VOL5.EXEC) to run the
BASIC programs  using the interpreter so everyone will be able to
at least review the new programs without a compiled version.

This is a program which will generate compound interest functions
including  present  and future  values of annuities, amortization
sinking  fund  factors,  and  accumulated  or discounted  values.
Entering 1  as the amount will generate values as can be found in
printed compound  interest tables  or by entering an amount,  the
intermediate  step of  multiplying can  be  saved.  Any number of
compounding periods per  year are allowed and any  range of years
can  be  displayed.  Note  that the  options  specify whether the
payment for an  annuity (regular payment) is at  the beginning or
end of each period.

You asked for  it, so here it is.  No big deal, just a convenient
little utility to reorganize the files on a diskette so that they
are all  contiguous and all of the available space is together at
the  end of  the files.   It does require that you  have a second
diskette in another  drive that will be used  as a "work space" (
actually, it is used to receive a backup copy of the files on the
disk you want to compress).

I wrote  it  in  a  few  minutes  after  reading Criss  Williams'

CURIES is a program to convert grams into curies or just to learn

radiation  exposure  from  common  isotopes  used in  medicine or
nuclear energy.

REMDOS is  a   program  to  calculate  the  cancer  effects  from
radiation  dose.   It  was developed  to provide a desk-reference
calculation of radiation cancer risk either in populations or for
individuals.

Both CURIES and  REMDOS are based upon the standard medical text,
RADIATION AND HUMAN HEALTH, by J.W.  Gofman (1981).  Contemporary
federal estimates would be ten times less severe.  If you ask the
military, its all nonsense - you can eat the stuff.  The programs

These six commands (with source code in assembler) do nothing but
read  the system  calendar/clock and  set the return code to  the
appropriate value.  (i.e.  executing MONTH will set RC = <current
month>) This may sound useless, but these commands will now allow
you to  write time and/or date dependent EXECs.  For example, you
can use  a program like TODAY.EXEC to remind yourself to pickup a
paycheck or  one like  DAYDUMP.EXEC to make backup copies  of all
the files newly created or revised anytime today.

The possibilities  are  endless.   I am  thinking about writing a
scheduler to  execute background  tasks at specific times of  the

Unique demonstration  feature: If  the program is not loaded from

The program assumes  that a  file key is smaller than  its record

DUMPDSK.ASSEMBLE
DUMPMEM.ASSEMBLE

DUMPMEM, allows you  to dump  any memory address to the  console.
DUMPDSK, allows you  to dump any disk sector  to the console.  On
both of them  you enter a decimal number  (memory address or disk
sector) or a  'C' (for cancel) and they  will dump at that point.
If you make a null entry (no characters or non-numeric) they will
continue  where  they  left off  (upon entry  they  will start at
zero).  The  drive  code on  the disk  dump  is set by the  first
parameter  of the  command line  (default is S), ie.  DUMPDSK  A,
will dump sectors  off drive A.  Note that  these programs do not
allow modification  of memory  or disk, they are therefore  a lot
safer  than  upping  your  privilege  level.   Bill  Berne  (206)

Only the  ASSEMBLY  versions  of these  two programs are included

You may assemble  both of the programs either using the automatic

making up the file.  As each segment is filed, a check is made to
see if  all  records  have  been  edited.  Only  when  the edited

OUG.RELEASE              PRESS.RELEASES
PRESSREL.EXEC

This is the  long awaited  OUG Press Release system, including  a
mailing list of appropriate publications.

OASIS compatible  software  product  promotion obviously  needs a
boost.  This package  pulls everything together that you  need to
launch  a successful  publicity campaign using press releases.  I
hope many of you will try it.

EDITORS.ADDRESS is our  first attempt to create a mailing list of
business  software  publication  editors.  The  first fifty names
were taken from an old list given to me by Phase One about a year
ago (coded  P).  The balance of the names came from several lists
which  I purchased  or was  given by members.  At this  point our
list is untested.  I would appreciate it if you would report your
successes (and failures)  in using it.  I would  like to add more
codes in the  future to indicate those publications  which review
OASIS  compatible  products,  run  our  press releases,  or carry
relevant advertising.  I'd also like to expand (and weed) it.
^
EDITQSRT.EXEC, EDITSORT.BASIC/EXEC are programs I use for sorting
the file in various ways.
ENVELOPS.EXEC/SCRIPT are   the   routines  I   use  for  printing
addresses on  envelops.  You will, no doubt, need to modify these
for your own printer, but this is a start.

OUG.RELEASE1 is  an  example  of a  professionally prepared press
release for the OUG.  It was done for us by Jerry Weltner of MBP,
the  European  distributors  for Phase  One.  Jerry,  as  you may
recall, used to  work for Phase One and  has been doing this sort
of publicity stuff for some time.

I asked Jerry  to  put  down  some  ideas about  how  to go about
organizing a  press release,  and the file PRESS.RELEASES is  his
contribution.   It  is good  solid advice  and  I recommend it to
anyone planning to use press releases.  FB

          Demo Included                                Volume 027

*** EXECMSTR ***  An EXEC program generator by Henry Aylward.

EXECMSTR is a full,  22 x 79 screen editor  written in basic.  It
is  a  program  generator  which  produces  standard  OASIS  Exec
Programs in EXEC format.  You can also create a full 22 x 79 Help
Display Screen  in  the  same  manner  as the  Selection  Display
Screen.

Since EXECMSTR  uses  a  full  screen  editor,  the  user  simply
'paints'  any  desired  input  selection and  help screen format.
Once  the screen  formats are  complete,  EXECMSTR will merge the
EXECSCRN and EXECBASE files to create the EXEC Program.  EXECMSTR
does all the work for you.

EXECMSTR consists of a set of programs.  They are:

     EXECMSTR EXEC     - Top EXEC that coordinates everything
     EXECMSTR BASICCOM - Main Menu Program to initialize variables
     EXECMSTR DOCUMENT - Script File Documentation, First file
     EXECMSTR INTRO    - Script File Documentation
     EXECMSTR SETUP    - Script File Documentation
     EXECMSTR MAINMENU - Script File Documentation
     EXECMSTR GENEXEC  - Script File Documentation

EXPANDI.BASIC/EXEC

At least once  a  month  someone  calls  me to  ask  how they can
increase the size  of an INDEXED SEQUENTIAL file  that has become
full.  Finally one  member suggested we should have  a utility to
expand  the  capacity  of  such  files.   So,  I  took the  basic
algorithm  from Joe  Trimble's FIND/ADD system and generalized it
for any  ISAM file.   I think it can be  improved, but here is my
first version.

This is a system  for keeping track of the  contents of a library

any  diskette  residing on  any drive.   You  can also remove all
references to  any named disk(ette).  The FIND program is used to
find the  location of any file or class of files in your library.
We are using  the system to keep track  of the Oasis Users' Group
library contents as it grows.  The information about the files in
the library are maintained in a file called DISKFILE.LIBRARY.  It
is important that  you be aware of the  possibility of confusion,
if you  maintain more  than one copy of DISKFILE.LIBRARY  in your
system.

It was contributed  to the library by its author, Joe Trimble.  I
am sure  you will find it to be one of the more usefull utilities
in our collection.  FB

If you need  grid reference  lines on a standard form  or on your

the thing for you.  The Page and Line functions are used to setup
the console screen size.  However, since BASIC takes full control
of the printer when it comes to page length, Formgrid leaves this
as a selectable option.  To override this one need simply use the
Page  and Line  function on  the channel on which the  printer is
opened.

DATAMSTR.BASIC/BASICCOM/GENMENU

This is  an important  new capability for generating (BASIC) menu
driven  programs.  The  author used  it  to rewrite the biorhythm
programs  also  included  on  this  volume  as  examples  of  its
possibilities.  The  complete system, DATAMSTR, does other things
too, but that  portion donated to the OUG  library, GENMENU, will
work without the rest of the full DATAMSTR system.

There is   a    demonstration   routine   included   which   will
automatically step you through the operation of GENMENU and there
is  a fairly  extensive users manual, GENMENU.DOCUMENT, in SCRIPT
format.   At  this  point  you  may  elect  to  run  the demo  or
read/print the users manual.  For more info on the full system or
on the use of the GENMENU portion call  its author, Henry Aylward
in Hawaii (808) 696-2509.

The system is not  as automatic as I would  prefer to see, but it
does work  fine.  After running the GENMENU utility to layout the
new menu for  your program(s), you will have  a new BASIC program
segment that contains  the menu data.  You must  then append that
to  a  "shell" called  MENUBASE.BASIC and  then  edit the "shell"
containing  your new  menu to  put in the references to  your own
SUBROUTINES or  BASICCOM program segments.  Improvements would be
welcome.  FB

GRAPHNET.BASIC/EXEC

GRAPHNET is  a  new on-line  facility for  sending  TELEX AND TWX
messages  using  your own  terminal and  modem.   They have other
capabilities, such  as  store  and  forward  and a  service  like
Western  Union  MAILGRAM.  It  is very  cheap  for most locations
(about 30 cents per minute for telegrams + $5.00 per month access
fee).  This utility just puts the necessary data at the beginning
and end of your own text file for compatibility with GRAPHNET.  I
think we can  do more with this facility,  and would welcome your
thoughts  on  the subject.   This program  was  submitted by Paul
Schindler (415) 254-4923.

LETTER.EXEC
FORMAT.LETTER


A simple exec to allow someone who is familiar with EDIT but, not
necessarily  familiar with  SCRIPT, to write generalized letters.
The EXEC makes a few assumptions about your system conventions:

All correspondence letters have  a file type of LETTER.   You can
print single sheet paper (8 1/2" x 11").

The EXEC does  not  print  the  letter.   It merely  gives  you a
head-start for  editing a  NEW letter.  It will let  you EDIT any
pre-existing letter  you choose, or it will do a FILELIST to show
you what letters you already have.

LIBRARY.EXEC
CONTENTS.BASIC/BASICCOM
DISKFILE.CODING/CONTENTS
ADD/FIND/NEWLIB.BASICCOM

This is a vast improvement in the ways we keep track of things in
the  OUG library.   It was  put together by Hanief Edwards  (614)
855-9618 by using the original VOLnn.CONTENTS files as a starting
point.   By adding  a  coded  line  at  the top  of  each program
description,  he was  able to  merge all of the individual  files
together into  one alphabetically organized file of descriptions.
His new  programs  for  finding  things  allows you  to  list all
programs in  the library  that have names starting with  the same
first characters (Try AD for example).

The programs  also  allow  you  to  merge  in  each new  volume's
VOLnn.CONTENTS file  and to  prepare 9 separate subject files  at
the same  time.  The  master DISKFILE.CONTENTS file is long  (now
about 4500  lines) so the printed version is  half an inch thick.
In preparing  to release this version of the merged CONTENTS file
I spent  two full  days going through it to  catch as many of the
errors and  inconsistencies  as  possible.   I  also ran  it  all
through the SCRIPT processor to make it look pretty.

Then to  finish  it off,  he integrates  his  new system with Joe
Trimble's DISKFILE.LIBRARY  system.  The new LIBRARY.EXEC ties it
all together.  It is really quite elegant.  Try it I think you'll
like it.  FB

I have  deviated from  our policy  of  only including ASCII BASIC
file  in  the library  (and of  not  repeating previously release
programs) to make  this a complete system self  contained on this
volume and because  the CONTENTS.BASIC program is so  big that it
wont even run on my single user BASIC interpreter!

LISTOBJ.EXEC and OBJLIST.BASIC

LISTOBJ.EXEC is  an EXEC  procedure similar to BASIC.EXEC that is
intended to make the task of listing a large number of BASIC type
files to the  printer a simple chore.  I  must admit that this is
one  of  the  advantages of  the choice  of  the BASIC file type.
However,  most  of  my programs  are saved  as  BASIC files and I
intend to continue  this practice.  Thus, I have  whipped up this
delightful  pair  of routines  to do  the  chore of listing large
groups  of such  files without overexerting myself.  Ron Brubaker

MCONVERT.BASIC/EXEC/INFO/MBASIC

Hold onto  your  hats, folks.   This is  a  biggie.  Jim Tillman,
mentioned  in the  previous program description, and his partners
put  this gem  together out  of desperation when they were  faced
with the enormous task of converting all of their MBASIC programs
to operate with  their new OASIS system.  Jim  says it saved them
months of  work.  I took the set of programs Jim sent in and made
a number of changes to make it easier for new people to use.  But
basically, Jim gets  all of the credit for  the original creative
work.

I have run  a couple of CBASIC programs through it, and SURPRISE,
many of  the MBASIC  algorithms work for CBASIC.  Looking  at the
differences  between  BASIC-E and  MBASIC suggests that it should
not  be  too  difficult  to  produce  other  conversion packages,
starting with  Jim's basic algorithms.  If you are faced with the
prospects of  a massive conversion from one BASIC to OASIS BASIC,
by all  means consider  working with me to get  a new version for
conversion of your  particular BASIC.  I really don't  think it's
going to  be all that hard, considering that we now have MCONVERT
as a starting place.

Jim Tillman's masterpiece  that converts MBASIC programs to OASIS
BASIC was originally  released on volume 11.  It  had a number of
known  bugs  and  shortcomings.   Jim  has reworked  the released
version so  that it now works a little better.  Be sure to report
any problems you  have using it to him,  so we can keep making it
better.   The EXEC  and INFO  files are identical to the  earlier

MEMBQSRT.EXEC

This is the  membership information  file updated as of 20  March
1983.  Each  record consists of six fixed fields and one variable
field.  The fixed fields include: FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, COMPANY,
STREET  ADDRESS,  CITY-STATE-ZIP,  and MEMBER  CATAGORY CODE-DATE
JOINED-PHONE.   The variable  field includes a description of the
member's hardware and software.

THIS IS PROPRIETARY  INFORMATION AND IS MADE AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS
OF THE  OUG  ONLY  FOR  PURPOSES  WHICH ARE  CONSISTENT  WITH THE
OBJECTIVES  OF  THE  OASIS USERS  GROUP.  GENERALLY SPEAKING, ALL
PROMOTION  OF YOUR  OASIS COMPATIBLE COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS
WOULD BE  CONSISTENT WITH OUR OBJECTIVES.  IT MAY NOT BE GIVEN TO
THIRD PARTIES.  IF IN DOUBT, GIVE ME A CALL.

The MEMBQSRT.EXEC  program  requires  a  copy  of the  commercial
QISORT utility  from QUANTUMN  INFORMATION.  It is a much  faster
(10 times faster!) way to generate various different sequences of
the MEMBERS.ADDRESS file than the MEMBSORT.BASIC program that was
previously  released.    Other  utilities  for  manipulating  the
address file were released with volume 13, you may recall.

Next time you  have an occasion to contact another member you may
find  it convenient  to go  ahead and generate all of  the sorts.
The different sequences make it easy to find people when you only
know a little about who you are looking for.

Several of our members  have already made mailings to  this list.
John Lapenta says he got over 30 responses and Bill Berne says he
got about  10-15.  So that's about average to good for mail order
response.  Another  of our members says he is going to coordinate
a  mailing  with  the release  of a  donated  partial system in a
future OUG volume.   I'll bet you can think  of other ways to use
it for promotion, too.  Also, be sure to check your own entry.

We might  consider  cooperative  mailings.   It  costs a  hundred
dollars just for postage now.  Let me know if you've got an idea.

changing the contents  of the DATA lines.  For  example, I'd like

OPAMP.BASIC

This is an  operational amplifier design program which allows you
to design  one of three different types of circuits: an inverting
amplifier,   a   non-inverting  amplifier,   and  a  differential
amplifier.   These  days, almost  no one  does  their own circuit
design, but  you never know when you might find yourself stranded
on   a  deserted   island  stocked  with  circa  1960  electronic
components and  an urgent need to put together one of these dandy
little  circuits.  It  was originally  written  by Frank Dacey in
about 1978 and  I converted it for OASIS  (I'm not sure why).  FB

planned),  and ACCOUNTS  PAYABLE (vol 33 planned).  Included with
this release is  a simplified means for installing  the system in
its compiled form  on your own computer.  Also  included is a set
of small test  files that you can use  for exploring the features
of the system before actually creating your own data files.

This is an excellent  adaptation  of  the  time  honored Osbourne
Accounting  System  which  takes  advantage of  the many expanded
capabilities of Oasis  BASIC.  You may want to  get a copy of the
published  Osbourne  manuals to  augment the meager documentation
included with  this release.  If you make any improvements to the
software or create  any new documentation, be sure  to get copies
to both Brent and me.  You will, no doubt, need to customize some
of the  programs for your own particular situation.  For example,
the state  tax  will vary  a lot  from  one state to another  and
federal tax rates change from year to year.

OTHELLO.BASIC

This is the  old classic game based on the Japanese game GO.  You
try to get  the largest number of spaces  covered by your markers
by capturing any  of the opponent's which you  can bracket.  This
version was converted  for OASIS by Jesse Josserand.   It is VERY
slow when the  computer is deciding which move  it wants to make,
and  it wastes  a lot  of time re-painting the display  each time
instead of  making  use  of  the  excellent OASIS  direct  cursor
addressing capability  (a la HEXAPAWN, etc.).  If you have a mind
to do it,  send us a rewritten version  that runs faster.  It's a
^reat game of strategy - lots of fun to play.

PACK.COMMAND

This is  a  true  disk(ette)  file  compaction utility  that will
squeeze out all interfile spaces, moving it all to the end of the
disk.  It was contributed to the library by Han-George Juerges of
DATASOFT  in Germany  - Telephone (06181)253737 (he speaks fairly
good  English).   This  is a  commercial product  donated  to the
library for your own use and demonstration purposes only.  He has
sold hundreds  of copies in Europe and would like to find some US
distributors.  As a consequence, no source code is provided.

I use  it  all the  time and  it is great.  It does  occasionally
leave one block uncompacted for some reason with floppies, and it
is VERY  slow with  my 13 Mbyte hard disk  - taking at least four
passes  of 10-20  minutes each  to squeeze out most of  the blank
spaces.     This   compares    with   the   Quantum   Information
"SQUEEZE.COMMAND" which  does the whole job in a little under ten
minutes.   BUT!   the  PACK.COMMAND  is  three times  faster than
SQUEEZE.COMMAND with a double density floppy containing about 130
sequential files.  So, take you pick.

4040   Mountain  Creek   Rd  #1409,Chattanooga,  TN  37415  (615)
877-2716.  He would like to do something with it commercially, so
this is an  end-user-only copy (as with most  OUG library items).
The  documentation is  skimpy and  there are a few places  in the
code  where  improvements could  be made.   With  these things in
mind, you  will still  find PCP is a complete,  fully functional,
ready to run system.  If you make any improvements to it for your
own use, please let both Bill and me know.  FB

PDQ is a  full database management system with screen generators,

have been  added to  the OUG library for members  to use at once.
With  this entry  we launch  a major new era for  OUG activities.
The full  system is  a commercial proprietary product and  is for
sale by  the developer,  FST.  Included here is a  description of
the  complete system,  a description  of  just that portion which
John Lapenta contributed to the OUG library, an automated demo of
the  file  maintenance portion,  and the several file maintenance
modules  which  he  contributed.   Because it  is proprietary, no

PHONE.BASIC/PROJECTS/CALLS/EXEC

I am an  office automation  consultant.  The majority of my  $400
phone bill each  month is billed to clients.   I use this program
to  record  all  my calls  every day,  thus  greatly reducing the
amount of  work required  at the end of the  month to either bill
clients  or  allocate costs.   For those clients requiring detail
billing, we simply  send them a copy of  the printout.  I believe
the  program  is  self-explanatory.  Once  it has  been  used, it
creates   a   file   called  "PHONE.CALLS"   and  another  called
"PHONEC.BACKUPC"  which   contain  call  detail  information.   I
usually  back up  once a  week or so, just in  case "PHONE.CALLS"
gets bombed.  Paul Schindler (415) 254-4923.

Hold onto your hats.  This is Bob Chapman's latest upgrade of his
already excellent  spelling checker.   This one is a lot  faster,
automatically  checks plurals  against singular forms, and allows
you to build  special word files that are  loaded into memory for
much faster  processing.  It uses direct files for the dictionary
segments.  PROOFCON.EXEC and it's companion, PROOFCNV.COMMAND are
provided for generating  the new dictionary.  The old  version is
left  unaltered.    You  have  the  option  of  going  ahead  and
generating  the  new files  at this  point and of seeing the  new
documentation PROOF.NOTES.  The new dictionary takes up about 600
Kbytes of  disk  space,  so  be  sure you  have  that much before
proceeding.  Also,  be warned  that it takes several hours  to do
the generation (about four or five).   (NEW dictionary files are

PRUFREED, follows more  closely the logical approach used  in the
early basic program  - producing a list of  error words for later
use in  correcting the source document.  PRUFEDIT works more like
the commercial programs,  pausing to let you accept,  correct, or
"learn" words not found in the current version of the dictionary.

Bob Chapman (416) 845-2203 or 827-4173 is the author of both.  He
is still working  on improvements to the programs  and would like
feedback from anyone who is interested in the further development

him a very energetic and innovative person.  Give him a call.

over.  This program  is meant to be used  as part of a logon EXEC
to make your "sign-on" a little more interesting.


This program uses 2 files:
 1. QUIP DATA contains the encoded message text.
  (uneditable sequential file)
 2. QUIP RECORD contains the next record number.

RSEARCH.EXEC
RSEARCH1.BASIC

Again from Hanief Edwards (614) 855-9618, this new program allows
you to search  through any ASCII sequential file  to locate those
records containing any specified search string.  So, for example,
if you wanted  to know which members in  the OUG have Freedom 100
terminals,   you  could   search  the  MEMBERS.ADDRESS  file  for
"Freedom" and out  would come a new file  (name specified by you)
containing all  of the  records in the input file  that mentioned
"Freedom".

While I   am  personally   most  grateful  for  this  new  search
capability,  this  program  also  allows  you  to  make wholesale
changes  to records  in files,  merge records from more than  one
file, and  to delete  or extract records form one  or more files.
These  other capabilities  are important  in  their own right and
make this a valuable many use utility.

This is a giant leap forward for us, but it still falls far short
of what I would eventually like to see.  I have already made some
major  modifications to  the code originally submitted by Hanief,
and will  probably work on it more myself.  If you feel inclined,
take  a  look at  it and  see if you can't make  it a little more
elegant, yourself. An assembly version would be nice, ultimately.

SCIFI.BASIC

I ran  across  an interesting  flow chart  in an old issue of  my
favorite   magazine,   OMNI,   and   got   intrigued  about   the
possibilities  of automatically  writing science fiction stories.
So when  I should  have been working on our  next volume, I wrote
this little ditty.

I think it could  be greatly enhanced and would  invite anyone so
inclined to  take a crack at it.  For example, each element could
be expanded to  a sentence, or whole paragraphs  might be brought
in at  various points,  etc, etc.  The larger problem  of machine
generation  of fiction  is even  more  fascinating.  I imagine we
will have  machine AIDED  writing tools for fiction writers  long
before  the   machines  themselves  actually  do  any  reasonable
"creation." FB

This is  an   EXEC  to  generate  an  alternate  version  of  the

printers like the DEC LA34 to print with boldface and underlines.
I didn't  try it because my Sanders Media 12/7 printer is already
too fancy,  but I don't see any reason why it couldn't be adapted
to other printers  as well as the DEC  LA34.  I'd suggest you try
it and  then contact the author for more info if you need it.  It

SHOFIL.EXEC
SHOWFILE.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND
SHOWFMCK.COPY
SHOWFUNP.COPY

The OASIS  "FILELIST"  command  does not  show the  key  size for
Indexed  and Keyed  files.  In  addition, some of the other  file
parameters  are  encoded  in  a  rather  cryptic  fashion.  These
limitations are imposed by the requirement that each file's entry
fit on a single line.

The "SHOWFILE"   utility   was   written   to  circumvent   these
limitations.  It  displays a file's format information (including
key length and percentage of records in use for Keyed and Indexed
files) in a  more readable format.  Since the  display fills most
of  the   screen,  this  utility  allows  only  a  single  file's
parameters to  be displayed at one time--no wildcards are allowed
in the file  specification.  The utility will work  with any file
format.

This program uses  two routines  which may be of use  to assembly
language  programmers.  "SHOWLMCK.COPY"  is used at the beginning
of  an OASIS  program.  It  tests to see whether there  is enough
memory to  run the program.  It also tests to see if the user has
requested  "HELP"  and displays  the help message if appropriate.
"SHOWLUNP.COPY"  will  unpack the  date and  time  from the OASIS
packed format.  It has the reverse effect of SC 46 ("PACK").

This is a complete  system for managing the day  to day operation
of  a  doctor's office,  replacing the  "pegboard"  system now in
common use.   It maintains ledgers, rolledex cards and daysheets.
It prints bills,  does monthly summaries, prints bank  totals and
daysheet  summaries.   It  does  NOT  replace the  medical chart.
Inclusion of  the source code here allows you to customize any of
the output to fit your particular needs.

This system was developed by Larry Plumb, M.D.  of LARP SOFTWARE,
5037  Lakeshore  Road, Hamburg,  NY 14075.  For discussions about
STARDOC he can be reached at (716) 627-7770

You may,   of   course,   use  this   software  yourself  without

STRATING.BASIC/INDEXED

This is an  excellent Startrek game that we have been playing for
about 5 years.  It was obtained from the users library offered by
BTI (Basic  timesharing, Inc.) and we have modified it for OASIS.
The original  game was one program, but we have broken it down to
run on smaller  systems.  STARTREK and STCOMPUT are  the programs
that actually operate the game.  STRATING is a program that tells
you if  you have won or lost and keeps a record of the high score
achieved and  average scores for other players.  STRATING.INDEXED
is the file  where the scores are stored  for use by the STRATING
program.  There have  never been very many instructions  for this
program, but  if anyone is interested have them contact us and we
will  try to  write some  out and mail them.  We  learned by just
playing it over and over.  Tom Carolyn Cannon (503) 772-5746

intimacy  it  could be  just the  simple  vehicle needed to reach
important breakthroughs.   I am quite sure there will be some old

These are  two  programs  for  transferring  files from  Model II

this  is  via TRSDOS-->CPM-->OASIS.   TRSGET allows  you  to do a
direct  conversion  without  the expense  of buying a REFORMATTER
package.  TRSDIR  is  a  utility  which  allows you  to  read the
directory  on  TRSDOS diskette  and either  display  or print it.
These programs  function similar  to the GETFILE utility in  that
they only  allow reading  of the foreign diskettes and  do not do
program conversions.   As you  are aware, Microsoft Basic is  not
compatible  with  OASIS  Basic  and the  programs require further
translation.  Robert Chapman (416) 827-4173

UNPacks a  file generated  by word processors like SpellBinder or
MagicWand and puts it into a normal ASCII file.  Once again, this
is written in  "C" and was submitted by  Scott Watson.  I hope to
see many more programs written in "C".  FB

USRGROUP.ADDRESS is  a  mailing  list for  about 240 other Users'
Groups listed  in several publications.  It is in SCRIPT form for
input to  the labels programs.  USRGSORT.BASIC is a program based
on  the Trimble  sort for  sorting the mailing list into  several
meaningful sequences.  I put this all together.  FB

This is a collection of brief descriptions of the contents of all
the volumes released so far.  You asked for it, so here it is.  I
printed out the  whole collection for myself and  find the "book"
very useful.   You might give some thought to doing the same.  At
the same time,  why not LIST to the  printer the DISKFILE.LIBRARY
file and  then you'll have an alphabetical index to everything in
the library as  well.  After you have printed  all this stuff out
you will understand why I didn't do it and distribute the printed
version.  Postage alone would have cost a fortune!  You will note
that  the   text  is  substantially  the  same  as  that  in  the
VOLnn.EXEC's.  There are a few modifications, but very few.  FB

There was  a  catastrophic  error  in the  VOL18.EXEC.  This EXEC
routine corrects  it.  Copy it to the Volume 18 diskette and then
execute it.  It's automatic.

was submitted  by David  Skulski (604) 731-4525 I don't  have the
telephone dialing modem, so I wasn't able to thoroughly test this
myself.  Looks OK though.

WEATHER.BASIC

This program by an unknown author, but converted by me for OASIS,
lets  you  predict  tomorrow's  weather  from  known  facts about
today's weather.   I have no idea how accurate it is, but suspect
it is at least as good as the TV Wiz Kids.  FB

It is a 3 - 4 player hangman type game "Wheel of Fortune".  It is
played according  to the rules of the TV show.  (The program does
not explain them.)  There are bugs in the  "end game" (it doesn't
know when to quit).

WISHES.BASIC

This is  an  elementary  grade  learning  program.  It  gives the
student practice in  using color words and short  sentences.  Not
much to it unless you happen to be about 8 or 9 years old.  Might
be a  fun way  for kids to learn how  to interact with computers,
though.  I have no idea where it came from.  FB

THIS PROGRAM MAKES  A HIDDEN WORD PUZZLE.  I MUST CONFESS THAT IT
IS ONE OF  MY FAVORITES.  GREAT TO MAKE  PUZZLES FOR FRIENDS WITH
ALL THE HIDDEN WORDS HAVING SPECIAL MEANING FOR THEM, ALONE.  OR,
MAKE ONE  WITH JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE'S NAMES.  LOTS OF FUN.  THE
AUTHOR, UNFORTUNATELY  IS NOT  KNOWN.  I CONVERTED IT FOR  OASIS.

IF I WERE  IN CHARGE OF THE WORLD, I WOULD CERTAINLY PUT TO DEATH
THE INDIVIDUAL  WHO CONCEIVED  THIS PARTICULAR GAME (AND ALL  THE
VARIETIES OF  'HURKLE' WHICH USUALLY SURFACE IN THE SAME SOFTWARE

PERSON WHO ADAPTED  THIS FOR BASIC-E HAS NOT  YET BEEN ADEQUATELY
REWARDED FOR  THEIR PATIENCE.  REWRITTEN FOR OASIS BY FB.  BY THE
WAY, I THINK IT'S A GREAT LITTLE GAME - AT LEAST UNTIL YOU FIGURE
OUT ITS  CONSISTENCIES.  NOTE:  THERE IS A MUCH MORE  INTERESTING
VERSION ON VOLUME 10.

WUMPUS2.BASIC

This is a  more elegant  version of the game, WUMPUS,  originally
released on Volume 1 a long time ago.  This one allows the player
to select  any one of several different geometries for the caves,
making  the game  somewhat more  varied  and interesting.  I must
confess to having  lost the origin of this  contribution.  If the
person responsible will own up to it, that is let me know who you
are, I will gladly give you the recognition you deserve.

X.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND

This is  a  multi-function  program that  lets you access various
information in an EXEC by placing values in the "return code".

The passing  of TIME  DATE values  had not occured to me  before.
The credit for this feature, and my thanks, goes to Mark Amber.

In addition to those  parameters, this program can also  pass the
"Day of  Week", in which case, it returns a value in the range of
1 to 7, where 1 is Saturday so you can test for a weekend:

X WEEK IF RETCODE LT 3 GOTO -WEEKEND

If no parameters are  given, the program "clears" the  screen and
sets the RETCODE to the current "partition number".

If the   parameter   is   not  recognizable,   the  program  goes
"conversational" to ask you what you want.

ZAP.ASSEMBLE/EXEC/NOTES
ZAP$.COMMAND

This is  a  disk sector  modification utility similar to SUPERZAP
and called,  appropriately, ZAP.  It uses full screen editing and
^s quite elegant.   It was written by Bob  Chapman (416) 827-4173
one of our  most professional "hobbyist" members.  I'll  bet this
one is  going to save somebody's rear end sometime when they find
that the  only copy of a very important disk has gotten corrupted
somehow.  I  haven't had  any occasion to use it  much, but it is
very easy to use.
