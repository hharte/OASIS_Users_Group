NEWSLETTER - Volume 11                             30 March 1982



Dear Member;

Greetings again.  As  it happens, I have held Volume 10 to send out with
this one.   Frankly, I thought it would be ready a lot sooner than this,
or I  would have sent 10 along around the first week in March.  Oh well,
the road to hell is paved with good intentions, so they say.

This volume (11) has got to be one of the best yet.  The MBASIC to OASIS
BASIC  converter alone  make it  a winner.  Add to that  the 76 programs
from "Some  Common BASIC  Programs" (Osbourne), and you have  one that's
going to be hard to beat.

Coming soon in the  near future (Volume 12 ??)  will be the complete set
of programs published in "Practical BASIC Programs" again from Osbourne.
Certainly we are  due for an updated membership  list, and that probably
will be in Volume 12.

I don't want  to make  your mouth water, so I  won't tell you everything
people are  promising to  submit in the near future,  but there are some
really  great  things coming!   I have  been urging everyone to send  us
"utilities" for converting programs in other versions of BASIC to OASIS.
Now we have our first one.  I think we should have one for CBASIC in the
near  future, also.   Yes, I  know Phase One just announced  their's (at
$250  !),  but we  were talking  about it long before they  made their's
available.  I'm  sure there will be a "market" for both, as usual.  But,
once again it will be hard to beat our "price."

We still  need someone  to run  our dictionary through one of  the other
commercial  spelling  checkers.  There  are definately some non-words in
our  SPELCHEK dictionary.   It shouldn't  be such a big deal  to run our
list against theirs.  Come on you guys.  Volunteer.

If you  are  one  of  the  people  promising  great  things,  please  be
encouraged to  get your  masterpiece finished and send it  in.  I do let
hints slip now  and then when people call  asking about the availability
of this or  that kind of program.  So,  someone is certainly waiting for
your goodies (even if it is only me.).

Speaking of goodies,  I still have 3 boxes of DSDD Wabash diskettes that
I  want to  get rid  of at $35/box.  Also, I  have 30-40 TI 2716 EPROM's
(the  multiple  voltage type)  for $8  each.  Wearing my other hat  (The
INFO-MART) I  am a dealer for the Votrax TYPE-'N-TALK speech synthesizer
($359) and the Microcompatible MICRO-CUE hardware spooler ($269 up).  We
are also  dealing most of the popular CP/M software for any of you folks
out  there  who  can't find  exactly what  you  want for operation under
OASIS.

Along this same  vain,  I  have  been  having discussions  with  several
producers  of  commercial  OASIS  compatible  software  about  marketing
ventures.  The discussions  have run the gamut from  discount offers for
OUG members  to joint  national marketing efforts to the  creation of an
OASIS  software supermarket  offering the  wares  of many OASIS software
producers.  At the  moment our plans are still  in the early formulation
stages, so  if you have any ideas or want to discuss a joint effort, get
in  touch  with  me.  Any  such activity  envolving  commercial software
probably would  be handled under the INFO-MART banner - and handled in a
way  that  will  not detract  from the  great  achievements of the Oasis
Users' Group.  So, let's talk.



                                  Sincerely,


                                  Fred L. Bellomy

There were no feedback files submitted since volume 10.  Lots of
people called me, but no one sent in anything for this section.

SUBJECT:  "L O C A L"   U S E R S'   G R O U P S

Dear Member:

I've had  lots  of  inquiries about  members getting together and
sharing  the  cost of  standing orders,  or  giving away software
contained in the library to third parties.

While it is true  that the majority of items  in the library were
placed  in  the public  domain by  their  authors, our particular
conversion  of  programs for  the library is copyrighted.  Almost
everything in the library has undergone some refinement by me and
other  members -  in some  cases our final versions are  not even
recognizable as  the  originals.   To  what  ever extent  we  are
entitled  to  copyright  the  results of  these, sometimes rather
significant efforts, we have done so.

Also, copyrighting the  library is  in part due to the  fact that
there  are  indeed  many  items  now  in  the  library  that  are
themselves copyrighted  and for  which we have only acquired  the
right to distribute end-user copies to our members.

IN A NUT SHELL,  THAT MEANS THAT NO ONE  MAY SELL ANYTHING IN THE
LIBRARY, AND  THAT EACH MEMBER HAS AN END-USER LICENSE TO USE THE
THINGS IN THE LIBRARY, ONLY.

I'm trying to walk  a practical middle path that  will be fair to
everyone concerned.  In  this regard, I have authorized  a number
of people to  share their copy of the  library with other people,
with the provision  that each of the other  people become members
of  the Oasis  Users' Group  (by paying the $35 membership  fee).
And,  I am  generally willing  to stretch this policy to  fit all
kinds of special situations.

This seems to  me  a  very  liberal  and fair  policy.   It is in
everyone's  best  interests to  keep the  OUG  strong and viable.
And, that means  the people who benefit from  it must support it.
If we get too many free-loaders, either too little income will be
coming in or the paying members will be paying too much.

If you have  the  entire  library,  don't  give it  away  to your
buddies, UNLESS  THEY ARE ALSO MEMBERS of the OASIS USERS' GROUP.
The OUG library is being developed exclusively for the benefit of
MEMBERS.  If they are not members, ask them to join and then give
it to them.  That way everybody will be happy (and legal).

The nature of  OASIS is such that we probably will never have the
masses of  members  that  the  CP/M  or APPLE  groups  have.  Our
universe  is smaller  and many  OASIS users don't even know  they
have  it.  We  are  likely  to  remain  a relatively  small,  but
certainly elite  group - even with the ever growing popularity of
OASIS and OASIS-16.


                                           Sincerely,

                                           Fred L. Bellomy

THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAMS ON VOLUME 11.

***************************************************************


EXPANDI.BASIC/EXEC

At least once a month someone calls me to ask how they can increase
the size of an INDEXED SEQUENTIAL file that has become full.  Finally
one member suggested we should have a utility to expand the capacity
of such files.  So, I took the basic algorhythm from Joe Trimble's
FIND/ADD system and generalized it for any ISAM file.  I think it can
be improved, but here is my first version.

TO SEE THE HELP MESSAGE TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

EASES.BASICOBJ

This program will give you the financial data you need to make a
lease/buy decision.  It was submitted by it's author, Jim Tillman,
one of the partners in the CPA firm, Tillman, Giblin, and Riggs.


TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

CONVERT.BASICOBJ/EXEC/INFO/MBASIC

Hold onto your hats, folks.  This is a biggie.  Jim Tillman,
mentioned in the previous program description, and his partners
put this gem together out of desperation when they were faced
with the enormous task of converting all of their MBASIC programs
to operate with their new OASIS system.  Jim says it saved them
months of work. I took the set of programs Jim sent in and made
a number of changes to make it easier for new people to use.  But
basically, Jim gets all of the credit for the original creative
work.

I have run a couple of CBASIC programs through it, and SURPRISE,
many of the MBASIC algorhythms work for CBASIC. Looking at the
differences between BASIC-E and MBASIC suggests that it should
not be too difficult to produce other conversion packages, starting
with Jim's basic algorhythms.  If you are faced with the prospects
of a massive conversion from one BASIC to OASIS BASIC, by all means
consider working with me to get a new version for conversion of
your particular BASIC.  I really don't think it's going to be all
that hard, considering that we now have MCONVERT as a starting place.

FOR MORE INFO TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

HONEASK.BASICOBJ
PHONENOS.DATA
PHONEUPD.BASICOBJ

Joe Trimble submitted this handy program for keeping track of who
belongs to the phone numbers on your monthly bills.  A good idea
that should be a big help for all those folks who have to check the
monthly bills for unauthorized calls.
