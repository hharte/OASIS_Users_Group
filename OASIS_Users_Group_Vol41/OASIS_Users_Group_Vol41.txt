Good Morning;




VOL41: This  volume  has  two  big  packages: the  Microcomputing
magazine, Personal  Financial  System, converted for  us by Farny
LeGresley and  Chris Mallam, and a short term weather forecasting
system  from  the same  two guys.   There  are three separate and
different  Hayes Smartmodem  control programs, a cute CRT display
that tells the world that Oasis is for professionals, and a whole
bunch  of   new  utilities.   The  utilities  include:  ASCIDUMP,
HEXCMPR, and  LOCSECT which are a sampling of programs from Henry
Aylward's commercially available utility package.  I put together
BASICBIG to  allow  extra  large  BASICOBJ  files to  be  edited,
BUILDSYS to  create a new system disk with optimum file ordering,
and  FSORT to  prepare sorted  FILELISTs when there are too  many
files on your system for the regular Oasis FILELIST.COMMAND.  Joe
Trimble threw in a program for calculating "baseball" pools and I
submitted  the  EXEC  shell  I  use  for  introducing  new  basic
programs.   Finally,  there  are  source  programs  for  the  OUG
Copyright  display,  one in  basic and  one  in "C" from Aylward.
A darned good collection this time.

COMDEX: This year's  meeting no doubt will be of special interest
to many  of our  members because of the big  changes at Phase One
and  Otech  discussed  below.  Tim  Williams will  be  there with
others from  Oasis Technologies.  Tim will make a short technical
presentation about  what he has been doing and plans to do in the
future with  both the 8 and 16 bit developments.  Representatives
of  Oasis  Technologies  will  summarize  their  immediate  plans
following   the   recent  reorganizations   and  realignments  of
responsibilities; and will try to answer questions.

The meeting will  be held at the Las Vegas MGM Grand Hotel in the
Palace 5 conference room on Thursday, November 15 between 1 and 5
PM.  The  agenda will is still tentative, but will look something
like this:

>>   1:00 Welcome and OUG report by FB
>>   1:30 Where is Oasis now? by Tim Williams
>>   2:00 Coffee break + Announcements by members
>>   2:30 General Q/A session
>>   3:00 New Product Showcase presentations
>>   4:00 Technical clinics - ask the experts
>>   5:00 Adjourn

PHASE ONE  SYSTEMS:  As of  October 15th  they  are no longer the
exclusive  distributor  for any  of the  several  versions of the
OASIS operating system  created by Tim Williams.  On  that date a
Federal  judge  in San  Francisco granted  Tim  Williams (and his
company  Forth  Try  Inc.)  a preliminary  injunction prohibiting
Phase One Systems Inc.  from further distribution of any of Tim's
copyrighted software products.  Tim Williams (and Forth Try Inc.)
had  previously  filed a  5 million  dollar  lawsuit against POS.
Phase One in turn filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from
its  creditors.   For  months both  organizations reportedly have
been seesawing  between litigation and negotiation.  No less that
a half  dozen concerned third parties have offered their services
as mediators  in  an  effort  to  find win-win  solutions  to the
disputes.   Apparently  none  of  these efforts  fully succeeded,
because as we  go to press it seems  to be mainly the lawyers who
are talking to one another.

Tim Williams' other  company, Oasis Technologies, is now directly
handling  all  business  and technical  activities related to the
operating   systems    themselves,   including   implementations,
technical  support,  promotion,  and  sales.   Things  are  a bit
complex  for the  time being.   For example, the name Oasis  is a
Phase   One   Systems  trade   mark  which  they  maintain  Oasis
Technologies  will need  to acknowledge,  if  they refer to Tim's
copyrighted  operating system  as Oasis.  Otech appears reluctant
to do  this.   I  suppose  this  must eventually  lead  to a name
change,  if  they  don't eventually  reach some agreement.  (Good
lord, what would I do with all the stationary printed OUG?)

Some of  the  drivers for  Oasis on  the 16-bit Altos and IBM  PC
machines, and  the 8-bit  Tandy computers are owned by  Phase One
Systems.   Otech presumably  cannot sell Oasis for these machines
until  new  drivers have  been re-engineered.  Finally, Phase One
Systems owns  the copyright for all of the reference manuals, and
they currently may  be purchased only from Phase  One (they still
have  about  2000 copies,  by the  way).   Might  be a  good idea
to stock up,  if you are going to need some.   Otech tells me the
new users Guide is  in final editing and will  be published soon,
but it is not a full technical reference manual like the old ones
Phase One has.  When the 2000 are gone no one could say what will
happen.

Howard Sidorsky told  me that he plans for Phase One Systems Inc.
to continue doing business in areas related to Oasis, even though
there will be  no affiliation with Tim Williams,  Forth Try Inc.,
or Oasis  Technologies (the three have occasionally been referred
to as the holy trinity).  Howard says that Phase One Systems will
continue offering training classes; publishing the Oasis Software
Directory  (which  I  think  has become  an excellent promotional
piece this year,  both in graphic design and  contents); handling
Oasis  related  mailings  using  their  20,000 name  mailing list
(including 4000 that returned their license agreements); and will
continue  distributing  Oasis  compatible POS  software including
Control and Sort.

The roots of this latest round of disputes go back several years.
Relations between Phase One  and  Forth Try  principals,   Howard
Sidorsky and Tim Williams,  were on occasion strained as early as
1979, according to Kathleen Williams, Tim's wife. Since then, the
original  contract between the two has been renegotiated at least
twice, once in 1981 and again in 1983.  While the undercurrent of
discontent was not always apparent to outside observers,  it must
have been brewing for a long time.

During this  three year  period Oasis,  once  a bright and rising
star, has  been slowly sliding toward obscurity.  That it has not
suffered more is a tribute to a large group of dedicated computer
professionals who  recognize its superior technical qualities and
have  been  willing to  buck the  popular trends to use the  more
highly promoted, but inferior alternates.  These folks have stuck
with Oasis despite complaints about long delays in the release of
the  16-bit versions,  lack of effective promotional support, and
uncertain technical support from the top at times.

With the  public  clamoring  for  16-bit  systems  (albeit  often
inadvisedly),  fueled  by  the release  of the  IBM  PC products,
release  of  16-bit  Oasis  was  promised  by  Phase One  Systems
originally for the  second quarter of 1981, but  was delayed time
and time  again.  (The causes of this are hotly disputed by Otech
and  POS.)  When  it  was  finally  released  late  in  1983  its
performance   on  the   IBM  PC/XT  disappointed  many  and  some
maintained  that   it  might  be  too  little  and  too  late  to
effectively compete  with the flashy MS/DOS-UNIX front runners in
the 16-bit arena.

Sometimes overshadowing  the 16-bit  unavailability concerns, was
the often  voiced dissatisfaction by software developers over the
poor technical support  available to them for the  8-bit product.
Users were forced to work around known bugs or to implement fixes
themselves, as  many did.  In a number of cases manufacturers and
software developers created their own technical support groups to
offset what was otherwise unavailable from Phase One Systems.

Diminishing awareness  in  the  marketplace,  apparently  due  to
reduced media  advertising during this period, further eroded the
fierce  loyalty which  continued to  be displayed by a number  of
computer  manufacturers  and software  developers.  Lack of media
awareness  and  inadequate  promotional  assistance from  POS for
Oasis  compatible   products  has  been  the  single  most  often
mentioned concern voiced by OUG members during the past couple of
years.

Tim Williams  recently   pointed  to  the  cover  of  a  brochure
announcing a workshop on operating systems.  It mentioned several
of the  major ones  and he jokingly said: "there  we are right on
the cover: 'AND  OTHERS'." That pretty well sums  up the position
Oasis  currently enjoys  as far  as  media awareness is concerned
today, despite the  fact that the number of  microcomputers using
Oasis and Unix right now is still comparable.

OASIS TECHNOLOGIES:  In  talking to  everyone at Otech one cannot
help  thinking   that  we  have  indeed  turned  a  corner.   The
excitement level is high and there seems to be a clear commitment
to  do what  must be  done to get Oasis back  on the track.  They
definitely act like they mean business - attractive offices, lots
of equipment, business suits, and even ties!

During my  recent  visits  to  the  Otech  offices  in  Lafayette
California we talked  about many things related to  Oasis.  I was
especially  interested  to learn  that they  are  actively in the
process    of    establishing   some    form   of   international
distributor/tech-support network.  I was encouraged to learn that
they are currently  negotiating for first round financing  in the
range  of a  half million  dollars, and are planning a  major new
promotional campaign.   Tim  says  he  is  working his  tail  off
upgrading both  the 8  and 16 bit versions and  doing new/revised
implementations (among other things).  During the days I spent at
Otech   there  was   a  steady   stream   of  people  from  large
organizations  coming  to work  out new  deals  with them, and it
seemed like  the phones  never stopped ringing.  I was  impressed
and my personal optimism has never been higher!

CARAVAN: has  been   used  only  rarely  by  people  outside  the
continental United  States.  I've always thought it was primarily
the high  cost.  But,  while in Europe I learned  that is not the
case.  It turns  out that the standard modem  carrier frequencies
there  and  here  are not  compatible!  (The  September  issue of
Personal  Computing  had  a  good  article  on  the compatibility
problems)

A couple of  our  ingenious  members  have  hooked up  Bell  212A
compatible modems  to their  phone lines in Europe and  find they
work just  fine for talking to machines in the U.S.  (but not for
other machines  in any of the European countries).  Roland Ressel
in  Hof  Germany (phone  09281-64160) is  attempting  to set up a
bulletin  board  service for  German speaking  Oasis  users and I
learned  that one  or more  of  the telecommunication networks in
Europe has been interconnected with one or more of their American
counterparts.   I am  currently investigating several options for
opening  up  better  communications  with  our European  cousins.
Several of  you here in the States have indicated that you are in
the  process  of  or planning  to establish  your  own local BBS.
Please keep us informed of your progress.



Peace,

Fred:

I am about  to  upload  the  latest  DIAL.EXEC.  I  will  call it
DIAL2$.EXEC  as  per  your  DIAL-numbering  sys.   The  auto-dial
feature has saved me hours already!

"My" DIAL.COMMAND kinda  assumes that the user has ver 5.6 of the
TERMINAL  command.   If  they  don't, and  the non-supported "GO"
option causes problems,  just remove the "(GO" from  the assembly
code, or  else use  SED to change those three  bytes to spaces in
the COMMAND!

Enjoying Europe?   Heard  about any  new bugs regarding the COMMA
option?????????

Dear Fred,

So, here is another  program which I don't use:  It is a complete
personal  accounting  package  called  Personal Financial  System
(PFS).   There  are  two  minor  problems  which  bother me,  but
normally wouldn't bother  most people: It won't let  you overdraw
an account; but I did fix the editing procedure so that it works.
I also find that the report program won't work - probably because
it is using the other date format.

Well, enough of this  drivel, I must go out  and finally get this
posted.    I  apologize   for  sending  software  not  thoroughly
debugged; however,  at the rate I am going, and since you like to
muck  about  with  these things  anyway, I  send  it in less than
perfect form.

So, as Forrest Myers used to say,

                                        many happy RETURNS,

                                        Chris Mallam

     Dear Fred,

     i do believe  that i  have got located all the  difficulties
with  PFS  and rectified  them.  The  date  thing was the primary
offender.   i also  removed all  references  to toggling back and
forth  between  page 1  and page  2,  which my terminal supports.
There really are a lot of changes to be made to these programs to
customize them to the individual user.  i certainly hope that the
membership work with copies rather than originals of the program.
Note  that if  you detach  everything except the console and  the
drives,  the  programs  will all  fit in  Basic  in a single user
system.  Note  also that the system line editor can be used to do
the job.  (PFS$AR may be too big for some systems - like mine)

     If anyone comes  up with a patch to Oasis to support the ISO
date standard  (YYYY-MM-DD), i would certainly like to hear about
it.  It  is perfectly logical to list the most significant digits
on the left and the least significant digits on the right.

     Well, the post  office closes  in 15 minutes, and i  want to
get this off today!

WISH LIST #41 - I wish somebody would ............1 November 1984
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

77. A  utility  for  managing  multiple  jobs  running in several
different user partitions at once using a single console for  the
control of all jobs.

76. A financial planning package.

75. A modification to the REPAIR.COMMAND which allows it to stop
each time it finds a problem, giving us time to see what's going
on.  Also, a utility that automatically saves the corrupted file
segments, then goes ahead and FIXes the misallocations, and then
reports all of the actions which have been taken.

74. A generalized report generator.

73. More tutorial contributions plus an EXEC to integrate them.

72. Evaluations of public domain libraries for very good packages
and conversion of them for operation under Oasis.

71. File library  utility  for  combining (and un-combining) many
small files into one for better utilization of disk space.

70. A version of FILELIST which will allow us to specify which drives
to include in the combined list without attaching only to ones we want.

69. An Oasis-8 shell to run under Oasis-16 so that old software
can be run without modification.

68. A SUPER <esc>Q that will allow us to break out of a system
lockup (impossible???).

67. A set of "standard" business letters in SCRIPT format ready
to accept address information in an interactive mode.

66. Custom dictionary files for special areas like law, medicine,
engineering, etc. to work with the PROOF spelling checker.

65. A  program  for  recording  and  analyzing a  tennis player's
performance.   Statistically evaluated  faults might help players
(like me) improve.

64. OASIS implemented on MANY more Z80 machines.

63. Programs  that   integrate  logical  groups  of  OUG  library
programs.

62. Someone to write reviews of the contents of the OUG Library.

61. A truly portable "lap-sized" Oasis compatible computer.

60. A MOUSE input for CONIN to work with menu screens or windows,
together  with the  necessary software  to make it work with  the
keyboard (through an RS232C port?).

59. WASTEBASKET  routine  for  purging no  longer wanted files on
active  disks,  but  keeping  them  available  in  some  sort  of
"history" file(s) on a separate disk or series of disks - maybe a
modification of PURGE.EXEC.

58. I  need  faster  means  for  manufacturing new  volumes.  The
combination of INITDISK and BACKUP takes too long now.  How about
one command that does both functions in one pass?  I've been told
it can't be done!!

56. We  must   develop  a  networking  (LAN)  and/or  distributed
processing capability under Oasis.

55. Windows for running multiple applications simultaneously from
one terminal in multiple partitions.

53. We need a chart showing how  Oasis  Basic compares  with  the
others.

52. We need a method for RESTORING around a bad sector (or fixing
it) in an ARCHIVE file.

51. As we  begin to  get more people using Oasis-16  we will need
some new utilities  for moving things back and  forth between the
two versions.   In  particular,  we  will  need new  versions  of
SEND/RECEIVE (GIVE/GET??).

50. We  need  a diskette  format compatibility/interchangeability
summary.  8"  double density  and all 5.25" format diskettes  are
problems. (in preparation, but need your inputs).

49. We need  class code source for any devices not now covered in
the library (see volumes 18 and 34).

48. Someone  to  collect and  summarize information about all the
various commercial Oasis compatible software packages around now.

46. A set of indexes to all the Phase One OASIS manuals.

43. A utility for assigning synonyms for commands would be nice.

39. We  need the  compliment of  GETFILE  (PUTFILE?) for CP/M and
other operating systems.

36. More  people  to  write articles  about OASIS  or  letters to
publications  about  such  articles  they have  seen.  More press
releases  about  your  own OASIS  compatible commercial software.
Etc.

30. A  utility  for  automatically figuring  out the optimum disk
ATTACH  values  for HDL,  STP, and  STS for all of the  different
systems now operating under OASIS.

29. A  list  of  the 500  most frequently  used  words in English
writing  for use  with Chapman's latest spelling checker's CUSTOM
dictionaries.

27. A grammatical error checker.

26. Compilers for Tiny C, Pascal, Fortran, PL/1, ADA, LISP, etc.

23. A spelling  checker that keeps track of frequently misspelled
words and automatically corrects them.

â–¼ ANT A PRINTED COPY OF THE PROGRAM INFO AS WELL? [Y/N]:N





THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAMS ON VOLUME 41.

*****************************************************************


ASCIDUMP.COMMAND/HELP

This is a  utility for  doing and ASCII dump of  any file on your
system.  It should proove to be a valuable debugging tool for you
system  programmers who  need to  inspect  and modify COMMAND and
BASICCOM files.   There  is  no  documentation,  but it  is  very
straightforward to use.  Just enter ASCIDUMP followed by the file
name.   The output  file will  have the same name with  file type
SECTORS.  It  was submitted  by Henry Aylward and is  a part of a
utilities package  which he offers for sale.  (808) 969-2589 (See
also the companion utility, HEXCMPR)

WANT TO TRY IT NOW? [Y/N]:N

ASICBIG.EXEC

This is a utility  for bringing BASIC or BASICOBJ  files into the
interpreter which  are too  large to fit using the  standard way.
This  trick  was originally  suggested by  Joel  Lefette of Oasis
Technologies.  On  my NNC 520 I go from a maximum space available
of 15078 to 21105 bytes for about a 6K increase.  FB

WANT MORE INFO NOW? [Y/N]:N

UILDSYS.EXEC

A utility for  copying all  the Oasis system files from  a source
disk to a  destination disk in the order  which will make the new
system  run the  fastest under  most  conditions.  I adapted this
from an idea I got from an EXEC they use at NNC for preparing new
system disks to go out with the machines they sell.  FB

WANT MORE INFO NOW? [Y/N]:N

OPYRITE.C/COMMAND/BASIC

The copyright notice program I had been using didn't work on lots
of machines  that couldn't handle half intensity and it was a bit
slow.   So, Henry  Aylward rewrote  it in "C" and I  will use his
version from now  on.  The source for both  versions are included
for information.

WANT LIST THE "C" VERSION NOW? [Y/N]:N

IAL2.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND
DIAL2$.EXEC

This is  a  set of  programs for  controlling the use of a  Hayes
Smart modem.   Submitted by Dave Klotzman, it contains a facility
for   storing   frequently   called  numbers   and  dialing  them
automatically.   He revised  the DIAL command originally released
on  volume  33 to  improve its  performance.  It will need to  be
customized for  your set  of phone numbers and system  parameter.
It does not have a HELP option, but is fairly easy to figure out.
(303) 473-5880.
WANT TO LIST DIAL2$. EXEC NOW? [Y/N]:N

IAL3.COMMAND

Yet another Hayes  Smartmodem dialer/controller, but this one has
an excellent  HELP function.  Henry Aylward contributed it from a
collection of  utilities he sells, so no source code is provided.
Contact him at (808) 696-2589.

IAL4.BASIC/EXEC

Again from Henry Aylward (808) 696-2589 comes a second version of
a  Hayes  Smartmodem dialer/controller,  but one written in BASIC
with  an  EXEC   (which  must  be  customized  for   your  system
configuration.  This one has a particularly nice menu.

FORCASTD.BASIC
FORCASTI.BASIC

This is a  short term weather forcasting program written by farny
LeGresley  (416)  987-4511 and  Chris Mallam (613) 236-0374.  The
two  last   BASIC  programs  have  some  mysterious  maintainance
function I haven't been able to figure out - don't seem needed?

WANT TO TRY IT NOW? [Y/N]:N

SORT.EXEC

Utility for generating  a sorted list of diskfiles when there are
too  many  for  the  standard  FILELIST  COMMAND  to handle  with
sorting.  It  uses the QISORT package and provides an output file
called SELECTED.SORTED:S.   I put it together out of despiration.
FB

WANT MORE INFO NOW? [Y/N]:N

EXCMPR.BASIC/EXEC

This is a  companion utility  for use with the ASCIDUMP  program.
This one  allows you  to do a hex by  hex comparison of two files
that you  suspect may  have differences.  Should be a  great tool
for  debugging  after  programs have  been compiled or assembled.
There is no  documentation, but the HELP option  should be enough
for anyone who  needs this to figure it  out.  It was contributed
by  Henry  Aylward from  a  package  he  sells  so no  source  is
provided.  (808) 696-2589.

WANT MORE INFO NOW? [Y/N]:N

OCSECT.COMMAND

This is  another  utility from  Henry Aylward (808) 696-2589 from
the package he sells.  This one allows you to locate the relative
sector number  for any  given combination of cylinder, head,  and
sector position on a track.  Not for everyone, but some will find
it useful, no doubt.  It has a good HELP option.

WANT MORE INFO NOW? [Y/N]:N
WANT TO SEE A DEMO NOW? [Y/N]:N

ASIS$$$.COMMAND

From Henry Aylward  again comes this cute little display.  Sorry,
but there is no source for this either.  Might be good for shows.

WANT TO SEE IT NOW? [Y/N]:N

UGBASIC.EXEC

This is the  general  EXEC  I  am  now using  to  introduce BASIC
programs in  the library now.  If you plan to submit programs, it
might save you some time in putting together an integrating EXEC.
Most all of the possible options are covered.  All you have to do
is customize it for your programs.  See PFS.EXEC for an example.

WANT TO LIST IT NOW? [Y/N]:N

AYOFF.BASIC

This is a program  that Joe Trimble uses to  decide how much each
of several winners in a "baseball" pool are going to get.

WANT TO TRY IT NOW? [Y/N]:N

FS.EXEC
PFS$AP/PFS$AR/PFS$RG.BASIC

This is  a Personal  Financial System  (PFS)  designed for use by
families  at  home.   It includes  both accounts receivables (for
handling  your  paychecks  and  other  sources  of  income)  and,
accounts payable (for  paying bills) modules as well  as a report
generator (to show  you how much you haven't  got, etc.).  It was
originally written by  James McClure in CBASIC and  was published
as a  three  part series  in the  June  to August 1979 issues  of
Microcomputing magazine.  The articles are very complete and well
written.  If  you  plan  to  use  PFS, better  get  a copy of the
articles as  there  is  no  other  documentation for  this  Oasis
release.  It  was converted  for Oasis by Farnie LeGresley  (416)
 987-4511 and Chris Mallam (613) 236-0374.
