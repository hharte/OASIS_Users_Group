Dear Member;

This new volume has got to be one of the best yet.  The complete
OSBOURNE Book, "Practical Basic Programs", is on it along with
a series of benchmark programs, a specialized database system,
a system for sending telegrams with your computer/modem, and
miscellaneous other goodies.

I've come to realize that OASIS is not getting as much "press" as
it deserves.  There are lots of reviews of CP/M and UNIX compatible
software, but precious little about the OASIS stuff.  It occurs to
me that we can probably do something about that.  Any time you have
occasion to write to the editors of any magazine you read, mention
that you would like to see more articles about OASIS.  If you have
commercial software, make sure all the appropriate journals get a
press release (or a series of them) describing your software.  Invite
them to review it, too.  Offer to send a demo disk.  I will be
putting out a computer journals mailing list sometime soon.  WE REALLY
MUST GET THEM TO START GIVING US A LITTLE SOMETHING NOW AND THEN.
After all, there are about 20,000 OASIS users now!

Speaking of demonstration disks, it occurred to me that one way to
satisfy many many people's curiosity about what various commercial
program packages do, would be to issue a series of brief demonstration
programs.  They could just summarize the special features of the
package, and then run through a short demo of how the output looks
in a typical application.  Of course there are problems with this.
The demo would have to run hassle free on lots of different kinds
of equipment, and would have to be very "user friendly."  I still
think the idea is worth some thought by you commercial software
developers.  Let me know what you think.  We need someone to be the
first to try out the idea.

Every now and then I start thinking about the tremendous potential
power the possession of a personal computer gives us.  For example,
we can very easily send out large numbers of "PERSONAL" letters
to decision makers expressing our concerns.  Or, quickly check some
complicated calculation that the general public must just accept
as fact.  I have just begun to think of the possible ways I can use
my system to bring a little reason to some of the insanity I see
all around us.  What about you?  If you have been doing anything
along these lines, I'd personally love to hear about it, and more
than likely will want to put information about it into the library.

The possibilities are endless.  For example, I'd like to see us start
a series of public concern "form" letters that the rest of us could
consider modifying and sending out on our systems.  Next time you write
your congressional representative send me a copy of the letter (on disk,
naturally).  If you make up a mailing list of names of people to go with
the letter, send that too.

For safety, we should probably avoid highly controversial subjects
in starting this sort of thing, but there are an infinite number
of problems around us that most of us recognize and agree
on (such as rising crime rates, health hazards, warped western values, etc.).
Why not start thinking about ways you can increase your effectiveness
as a change maker through the use of the tool you are using to read
this. Let's see what can be done.

O.K. Here's the latest on the BusinessMaster conversion project.
I'm still waiting to send out copies of the unconverted version
until the 120 odd programs are at least renumbered.  I have two
possibilities here.  Someone has promised to use CTRAN for us
on the programs as soon as it is actually available (as of 10 May
1982 it is still not released by Phase One Systems).  The second
possibility is that I may get our own version of CCONVERT prepared
first and use it.  We have MCONVERT as an excellent starting point
for the CBASIC2 version.  I would think that one way or another
we should be able to get started in a couple of months.

The most recent conversion of the two Osbourne books reminds me
to ask if there are any published collections of programs you
would like to see converted and modified for use with OASIS.
There are lots of books of programs in the book stores, most of
the ones I've looked at are not all that interesting.  If you've
seen any good ones, I'd like to hear about it.

Along this same line, what kinds of software would you like to
see being added to the library?  Would be authors sometimes ask
about the kinds of programs there seems to be special interest
in.  I know a number of members have a large number of old CP/M
programs they are planning to convert and would like advice on
where they should begin.  I listen to you, but very few people
ever mention the things they wish they could find.

If you are a member of another users' group, you might consider
using their library as a potential source for programs to be
converted for use under OASIS.  There is a little work envolved,
but it is almost always easier to convert a good program than
to start writing one from the beginning.  Quite a bit of the
things now in our library were converted from programs in one
of the CP/M Users Group Libraries.  And, there are hundreds of
users groups.  Also, many of the bulletin boards offer the
capability of down-loading software that can then be converted
for use under OASIS.  It's not hard to do at all.  Just takes
a little time and knowledge of the two Basics.

Our own Bulletin Board has gotten bogged down because of an
incompatibility between the Computer and version 5.5 of OASIS.
I haven't lost hope of getting it up and running, just haven't
had time to work on it lately.


After lots of conversations on the subject, I've decided to release
all future BASIC programs as ASCII files.  The tiny space saving
that results from putting them into a BASICOBJ form isn't worth
the questions from people (new users) who don't yet know their
way around the Interpreter/Compiler.  It wont really make much
difference to the rest of us, so GOODBYE.BASICOBJ and HELLO.BASIC.

Several of our members have pointed out how easy it is to make
any old SSSD floppy diskette into a double sided "flippy."  All
you have to do is punch a second set of holes in the jacket
like you see on regular "flippies" that you buy.  There is quite
a bit of tolerance for error, too.  I've now tried it many times
and have never found a diskette that would not initialize with
double density!  Of course the manufacturer doesn't guarantee
the back side to be error free, but then again 10,000 hobbyists
can't be wrong.  Might be just what the recession ordered.

Well, that's it for this volume.  I know this letter rambles a
lot, but then I don't plan to enter it in any literary contest
just now.  If you don't like mine, write some of your own, and
I'll put them on the next volume.

                                                          09 April 1982


Greetings!

     Here at last is the debugged CLOCK, which handles 12-hour or 24-hour
format, and the accompanying EXEC.  Also enclosed is the complete FILLFORM
set, with an example built into the FILLFORM EXEC, as per your request.  The
third program here is yet another version of REMINDER, prompted by problems I
was having with other people wanting to leave messages for me, but inadver-
tantly in the process getting all my messages for the day (which then get
cleared from the file).  I don't know that it's worth putting this version out
as a "What?  Again??" file, but decided to send it to you to judge.

     Volumes 10 and 11 are full, rich, and satisfying.  I haven't yet explored
everything included (far from it, actually), but the write-ups sound great,
and those I've tried look very good.  Congratulations on doing a bang-up job
again (as usual)!

     I'm looking forward mightily to Ron Brubaker's sort routine(s).  A fast
sorter is probably the single tool I want most, right now.  And if his work on
BLACKBOX is typical, he does excellent programming.

     YES---I am interested in discussing a joint venture into marketing OASIS
software.  I have several ideas, and would like to hear more, so let's talk!
More and more as I go along, OASIS looks like a great place to be.  If you can
call me sometime soon, great.  If I haven't heard from you be about April 21
or 22 I'll call you.  OK?  Alright.


     Quitting time . . .

                              Peace,

                              Joe Trimble

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Vince Oster called to tell me about a "bug" in the BASIC interpreter/Compiler.
Whenever you CHAIN or LINK to another program module, only the last file
OPENed is CLOSEd.  If you happen to have multiple files open, they will be
passed OPEN to the next module and you get an error if you try to open the
file again.  Thanks Vince

3.  We need to develop a cheap way for members to call the new OUG Bulletin
Board computer.  Does anyone know a way to use the networks (ie TELENET,
TYMNET, etc.) or other phone service for cheap "off hours" communications?

5.  We need a clearly written proceedure for setting up new class codes.

6.  We need a conversion routine for converting ASSEMBLY language code
from other Z80 systems to OASIS.

7.  We need a BASIC disassembler.

10. We still need conversion programs for lots of other versions of
BASIC.  True, we do now have MCONVERT for MBASIC programs, but that's
only one of many important dialects.  Using the algorhythms in MCONVERT
it shouldn't be that difficult to make others!  Give it a try.

11. Many members have asked for investment management programs.

12. Many, many other users group libraries need to be checked for
things that can be converted for use under OASIS.

13. Someone who can down load the OUG library from 8" diskettes to
the 5.25" diskettes for Vector Graphics and the IBM Personal computers.
Grant Krucik now handles all other formats for which anyone has
expressed an interest.

14. Someone to do an "in-depth" critical review of stuff in the OUG
library.

15. We need a roster of people who have done significant reviews of
commercial software offerings.  And, we need to know who you are.

THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAMS ON VOLUME 12.

***************************************************************


BENCH.EXEC/BENCH1.BASIC/BENCH11.BASIC/BENCH2.BASIC/BENCH22.BASIC

These are a series of benchmark programs designed to compare disk
access and processor speeds of different computer systems.  They
were originally proposed by IBC, but have been altered slightly
for this presentation.  An attempt was made to keep the performance
measurement results the same as the original, but that is not
guaranteed.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

LOCK.EXEC/BASIC

Displays current data and time in digital format on the CRT screen,
in either 12-hour or 24-hour ("military") form.  Created by Joe Trimble.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

PSON.COMMAND/ASSEMBLE/EXEC

UTILITY FOR SELECTING SPECIAL FEATURES OF EPSON MX-80 PRINTER.
SUBMITTED BY VINCE OSTER (605) 342-8455.


TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

ILLFORM.BASIC/DATAFILE/EXEC/FORMFILE/INFO
DATABASE.FORM$1/DATAFILE.FORM$1

This is a major utility submitted by Joe Trimble (415) 836-3281.
It allows you to create common forms and then to fill them with variable
data maintained in separate files.  It has lots of flexability and an
extensive set of it's own commands.  It's bound to be an important
new capability for a lot of you.  Thanks Joe.

FOR MORE INFO NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

EMIND.EXEC/REMINDER.BASIC/EXEC

This is an enhanced version of the program Joe Trimble originally
submitted some time ago.  He has added the ability to show what is
happening tomorrow as well as today.  It's a much better program
now. REMIND just retrieves messages, while REMINDER.EXEC provides
access to the full range of capabilities of the program.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

RAPHNET.BASIC/EXEC

GRAPHNET is a new online facility for sending TELEX AND TWX messages
using your own terminal and modem.  They have other capabilities,
such as store and forward and a service like Western Union MAILGRAM.
It is very cheap for most locations (about 30 cents per minute for
telegrams + $5.00 per month access fee).  This utility just puts the
necessary data at the beginning and end of your own text file for
compatibility with GRAPHNET.  I think we can do more with this
facility, and would welcome your thoughts on the subject.
This program was submitted by Paul Schindler (415) 254-4923.


FOR MORE INFO NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

KI.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND/DOC
OKIDATA.EXEC

Utility for setting up the parameters required by the Okidata "Microline"
model 82A printer.  It is easy to use.
Submitted by John Taylor (414) 367-5123.


FOR MORE INFO NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

EK4025.EXEC/MEDIA127

This utility is highly specialized for systems that have both a
Tektronix 4025 graphics terminal and a Sanders Technology Media 12/7
printer.  It programs the terminal function keys to issue printer
function commands to be imbedded in text files destined for the
printer.  I use it all the time on my system, and so offer it to
anyone who happens to have my same configuration or who is interested
in the general technique used. FB


TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

NT.EXEC

This is a demonstration of the Votrax Type-'N-Talk speech synthesizer.
I sell them and everyone wants to "see" it speak words they make up.
It temperarily attaches the printer to port 4 to which it is assumed
you have attached the TNT unit. It then goes through a "canned" speech
and then lets you type in what ever you want it to say.  Lots of fun
at a party!
