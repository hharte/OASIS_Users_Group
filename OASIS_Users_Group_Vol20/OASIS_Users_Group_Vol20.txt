Dear Member;


Well, it certainly has  been a long time since  volume 19, hasn't
it.   I  have been  super busy,  as I know some of  you have also
been.  First  was COMDEX  and dealing with all of  the stuff that
got  started  there.   Then  I  started  working  on the  subject
collections.   Everything is  now divided among eight catagories:
Utilities,     Games,     Business/Finance,     Engineering/Math,
Miscellaneous/Education, Spelling Checker/Dictionary, System, and
Information.   In  a future  volume you  will get all of the  new
EXECs that tie all of the things in each catagory together.  That
means you can  use UTILITY.EXEC to locate and  execute any of the
utilities, etc.

Many of  you   have  been  busy  too.   I  now  have  a  pile  of
contributions that will make us about another three volumes.  The
arrival  of  every   new  contribution  sets  me  to   work  with
preliminary  preparations  to insure  the author hasn't made some
catastophic  booboo and  that the  stuff  is basically O.K.  And,
during the past couple of months I've had a lot of that to do.

The biggest  news,  of  course,  has  to  do  with  our  changing
interaction  with  Phase One.   Howard Sidorsky's presence at our
Los Vegas  COMDEX meeting  was a welcome signal that  he knows we
can help each other in increasingly significant ways, despite our
differing views  on some issues - or perhaps because of them.  In
any case, we're  off to a new beginning  and Phase One is already
demonstrating it's good will in a number of ways.  They made us a
Northstar  master copy  of  the  OUG  library,  and a  number  of
potential  new  members  have  indicated  someone  at  Phase  One
suggested they  get in touch with us.  Howard has pledged to give
us as  much support as he can, including more frequent mention in
their  publications,   and  access  to  more  of  their  internal
information sources (eg publication mailing lists).

I learned all  of these things in a long conversation with Howard
a few  weeks  ago.  We  talked about  a  wide range of topics  of
mutual interest  to  Phase  One  and  our members.   I  asked him
bluntly  about the  rumors I  have been hearing that they  are in
financial  trouble.   What he  told me  was  that they are indeed
reorganizing  internally   and  restructuring  their  promotional
activities.   They  may be  looking for  venture  capital at some
point in  the near future, but are not engaged in any acquisition
negotiations  with  anyone.   The  recent layoffs  of several key
people  are a  results of  changing  internal priorities and have
been  offset  by new  hires.  In  writing it down here I  know it
sounds like  a lot pat answers formulated for public consumption.
But, I sensed a special spontaneous candidness in Howards answers
that  sounded right  to me.   I think some of that  restructuring
means more  confidence in  the OASIS user community's ability  to
handle the  truth, even  when it may not be  as rosy as one might
wish.

In that  regard, I  told Howard  how very much concerned a  large
number of you are about the delayed availability of OASIS-16.  He
related  all the  expected reasons  for the delays and gave  me a
capsule summary  of the current anticipated release schedule.  He
said  that OASIS-16  is now  available for the Compupro, will  be
released for  a special  purpose machine, the Canberra in  March,
and that the next two machines on the priority list are the Seako
and Cannon 8086 (a few months later).

I stopped by the Compupro booth at the recent West Coast Computer
Faire  and  asked  if they  were actually  delivering  units with
OASIS-16 and  the  guy  I  talked  to said  that  they hadn't yet
received the final release version for distribution, but expected
it momentarily.   Later, I had another long talk with Dick Wrenn,
Phase One director of sales, and he clarified the situation some.
Phase  One  works  with "sophisticated"  software developers on a
case by case  basis and makes available early  release copies for
testing and  use to  a few such people.  They  are very selective
and  only  work  with  vertical  market  software  developers  or
software  houses  in  this way  - those  who  will help swat bugs
without   a   lot   of   extraneous   resource  consuming   phone
conversations.  You get the idea.

How about  the  IBM/PC version?   Why hasn't  it  been given more
priority?  Howard says  they don't want to do  a hard disk driver
for the  Corvus drive and so they are waiting until IBM announces
their own hard  disk.  Dick Wrenn, volunteered that  a version is
already running with  a Corvus disk and a  few people are already
working  with  it.   Further, they  are getting  both  Devong and
Seagate  hard disk  drives and will immediately start preparation
of the  drivers for these.  He thinks an early version with these
drives may  be available  as soon as March or  April.  If you are
one of the  people who has indicated to  me that you are facing a
decision crises regarding  the PC, give Dick a  call at Phase One
(415) 562-8085.   He is not prepared to talk to the idly curious,
however.

I had occasion to  talk to the Oasis person  at the Altos factory
and he confirmed that they have declined to implement OASIS-16 on
one of  their machines only because it is now obsolete.  They are
working on implementation for their newer 16 bit units.

Two of you have  suggested to me that you  would be interested in
doing  OASIS   implementations  on  new  machines,  but  you  had
understood  that Phase  One was  not  interested.  I asked Howard
about it  and  he  said  he  is open  to  considering any and all
proposals  for  independent  implementations  on  a case  by case
basis.  He reminded me of their long standing "Guest Implementor"
program where a machine manufacturer pays $10,000 (was $5000) and
gets unlimited  support  with  their  own  efforts to  get  OASIS
running  on their  machine.   But,  he  says  there is  room  for
discussion. So if you have a special proposition, give him a call
(415) 562-8085.

The first versions  of OASIS-16 will, of course, be incomplete as
well as having a few well hidden bugs in them.  For one thing, it
will only  have a BASIC compiler so that programs developed under
OASIS-8 can  be moved  to the 16 bit machines,  but not developed
with a 16 bit interpreter.  The earliest versions may not include
full support of  ISAM files either.  But, they  are working their
tails  off  up there,  I am  assured by everybody!  So, keep  the
faith, baby.  It's coming.

On a different  front, people  who know OASIS are in  big demand.
At  least  I have  been contacted  several  times during the past
months regarding  the availability of OASIS programmers and other
support people.  I have heard that Compupro, Onyx, Northstar, and
even Digital Research are looking for OASIS knowledgeable people.
If you are  available (or if you are  looking for someone) let me
know so I can put people in touch with you when they call.

This reminds me of a really interesting rumor I heard from a head
hunter.  Digital Research (the CP/M people, you know) is supposed
to be  about to release a more user friendly version of CP/M that
uses OASIS-like  command structures.  I guess it will be the same
old  CP/M  but you  will be  able to COPYFILE instead of  PIPing.
Interesting,  no?  They  say that  imitation  is the most sincere
form of flattery.

Along the  "help wanted"  line, Hans  Juerges,  one of our german
members is  looking for  someone to translate the german  textual
displays of  his word  processor, AGTEXT, into good English.   If
interested, drop him a line.


All of my harping  about more publicity for OASIS  and compatible
products has resulted in more people telling me about things they
are doing.   If you are aware of any recent articles dealing with
any  aspect of  OASIS, let  me know.  I'm thinking in  terms of a
bibliography.

One of  our  members sent  me a  "happy  birthday" wish recently.
Well,  we  have been  in existence  since February of 1981, so  I
guess this  is our  second birthday of sorts.  HAPPY  BIRTHDAY TO
US.   HAPPY  BIRTHDAY  TO US.   HAPPY BIRTHDAY  DEAR  OASIS USERS
GROUP.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO US!







Peace,

Dear Fred,

The Users' group  meeting was  interesting, to say the least.   I
think  some  positive  progress  was  make there  in establishing
cooperation with  Phase One.   I do not believe Phase  One should
act as  an absolute censor to submissions.  Their comments should
be  taken  into account.   Even if  they do not want some-  thing
distributed, it  still may be distributed if it is justified.  If
it gets  out of  hand the members will let  you know, I'm sure of
that.   This should  not create  any animosity with Phase One  if
this situation occurs.

One attitude  expressed  (by  a sizable  minority) in the meeting
that  surprised  me  was one  of a  desire  for a non-competitive
environment.  I  will not  mention specifics however, I was  even
more surprised  when Phase One partially supported this attitude.
The  industry  we're  involved  in  is extremely  competitive, it
benefits  us all.   An  example  would  be  our Qisort  (no  plug
intended, you may delete the specific name).  We were faster than
the  competition,  when we  first released  it.   They speeded up
their sort.   We speeded up and enhanced our sort.  Customers who
buy either sort  benefit.  In the cases where  somebody undercuts
to  the  point  of  being  unprofitable,  we're  still selling  a
service, which implies  after the sale service and  support, that
is a very marketable item which most discounters can not provide.
Also they  can not survive long on extremely thin or non-existent
profits.

Enclosed with this  letter is a write up on a method to serialize
software to the Oasis Operating System.  It is only one approach,
use  it as  a basis  for serializing your own code,  be original.
Because  it does  identify a  critical point in the nucleus  (the
serial  number),  please show  it and  discuss  it with Phase One
first.   I  recommend  that they  use a  similar  tact within the
nucleus  and for  important commands  such  as ATTACH, etc.  Then
there would be no problem in releasing this method.

Well I've spent enough time on this for now.  I've got a stack of
things to evaluate from COMDEX that you wouldn't believe.

It was  a  good  meeting.   I  enjoyed  meeting  and  talking  to
everybody.  Have a good day.  Until the next time.

PS: Between the  time I wrote this letter and got it out, I wrote
two programs for  submission to the OUG.  DUMPMEM,  allows you to
dump any memory  address to the console.  DUMPDSK,  allows you to
dump any disk sector to the console.  On both of them you enter a
decimal  number  (memory address  or disk  sector)  or a 'C' (for
cancel)  and they  will dump  at that point.  If you  make a null
entry  (no  characters  or non-numeric)  they will continue where
they left  off (upon  entry they will start at  zero).  The drive
code on  the  disk  dump  is  set by  the  first parameter of the
command line  (default is  S), ie.  DUMPDSK A, will  dump sectors
off drive  A.  Note that these programs do not allow modification
of  memory or  disk, they  are therefore a lot safer  than upping
your privilege level.  Again, until the next time.

Dear Fred,

You and  I  recently had  a conversation about software companies
and  their decisions  to release  source code or not.  At  ABS we
have  taken a  very rational  stand on this issue as  we feel all
software  companies  should.   That is,  we decided, when mulling
over the  issue of  source code releases, that no  matter what we
did, someone  out their will be able to punch holes in our stuff.
That is,  whether we  choose to release source code  or not, some
hot  programmer or  garage  whiz  kid  is  gonna get  in.   We've
resigned ourselves  to that  fact and all we can  do is deal with
it.   So we  decided that  there was no other good  reason not to
release source code to reputable dealers.  Why worry?

Therefore, we have  also decided to release to the OUG, a copy of
a utility that we have had lots of fun with called 'UNLOCK'.  Get
ready for  this, IT REMOVES 'READ' PROTECTION FROM OASIS PROGRAMS
AND FILES!   Bet you'll have just as much fun with it as we have.
Not to  mention  the  headaches  it  will save  when  you or some
unknown person  'accidently' READ protects your files -- or worse
your entire disk.

So, with that  we wish you a merry christmas and a very happy new
year  and happy  birthday (so  to speak) to the user's  group for
another  years  existance.  We  love the  entire  OUG library and
recommend it highly to all Oasis user's.  Keep up the good work.

                                            Sincerely,
                                            Jesse F. Josserand

OASIS USERS GROUP
P.O. BOX 2400
SANTA BARBARA, CA. 93120

Dear Fred:
I would  like  to  ask  the  Group membership  to  respond to the
following questions  if they  are able.  I am willing  to pay for
the costs involved.

1. I create indexed  files up to 65000 records  each, all updated
in multi-user mode.  The record count is maintained for the first
operator to  access the  file.  This is unacceptable for  obvious
reasons.  I need a patch or routine that keeps an accurate record
count.   I  currently keep  the count  in a separate file, but  I
shouldn't have to.

2. Most  of  my  clients  use the  ALTOS-8000 multi-user computer
system.   The ALTOS  OASIS software  allows  2 physical hard disk
drives, and a  maximum of 2 floppy disk  drives.  I would like to
drive up  to 4  floppys with the hard disks.   I can easily do it
under MPM  11, but not with OASIS.  I have asked ALTOS, and PHASE
ONE, but they either won't or can't oblige me.  Someone must know
how to patch the system (5.5) so it will.

3. I would like  to find a low cost  single-user computer capable
of supporting OASIS.  Something like the BASIS-108 would be ideal
!!  I have a pending vert- ical market need for approximately 100
for openers.   The price  is the key, as is  maintainability, and
product support.  I  am not anxious to pioneer  after 25 years in
this business, so  those with breadboards or prototypes  need not
apply.

4. Fred, keep  up the good work.  As to OASIS promotion, the only
publication  that  routinely reviews  OASIS is Interface Age.  I,
for one, do  not intend to promote OASIS.   My clients could care
less  whether I  use MPM,  CPM, Xenix, or RSX-11M.  Promotion  is
PHASE  ONE's responsibility.   DECUS does not promote Digital, we
should not  have to sing PHASE ONE's praises, especially when the
software has glaring  faults (try spooling to a  disk that cannot
hold a large spool file !!!), the manufacturer is not responsive,
and makes promises  it can't keep.  I lost  2 large orders due to
the  unavailabilty of  OASIS-16, although promised months ago.  I
think,  if  not for  the USER  group, I would have dropped  OASIS
several clients ago.


                                        Sincerely yours,

Dear Fred,

As  you  can tell  from the  label on this diskette I  am finally
getting  finished some  of the  projects I mentioned in my  first
letter.   This  diskette has  two programs for transferring files
from Model  II TRSDOS  diskettes to OASIS.  The only  other way I
know of to do this is via TRSDOS-->CPM-->OASIS.  GETRS allows you
to  do a  direct  conversion  without  the  expense of  buying  a
REFORMATTER package.  RSDIR is a utility which allows you to read
the directory  on TRSDOS diskette and either display or print it.
These programs  function similar  to the GETFILE utility in  that
they only  allow reading  of the foreign diskettes and  do not do
program conversions.   As you  are aware, Microsoft Basic is  not
compatible  with  OASIS  Basic  and the  programs require further
translation.The  program  SNOOPY  BASIC on  this diskette was the
first file I used GETRS on and is included for purely sentimental
reasons.

I am well  on the way to completion of a disk sector modification
utility  similar  to  SUPERZAP  and  called, appropriately,  ZAP.
(being much  too modest for the 'super' prefix.) My intention was
to  include  it on  this diskette  but as always, it seems,  last
minute  changes crop  up -  in testing ZAP I found  minor bugs in
GETRS and RSDIR - so ZAP will have to wait for the next diskette.

Also on  this diskette  is  a  new  revision  of PROOF  which  is
somewhat   faster   than  the   previous  one  while  maintaining
compatibility  with  the spelling  file structure.  Hopefully, at
some future date, I will compress the SPELLING files so that they
will fit on  a single double density diskette.   I also intend to
investigate  faster   methods  of  verifying  spelling  than  are
presently used in PROOF.

The more  I program  with  OASIS  the  more  I like  it.   I must
honestly say  that I am in awe of Timothy S.  Williams.  OASIS is
a remarkable  achievement.  The fact that it is so good, however,
only further exacerbates the problem of poor software for the end
user.   I  have in  mind the  MASTERPLAN  package currently being
distributed  by  Phase  One  Systems.   This  package  is written
entirely in  BASIC, and  while it is very ambitious  in its scope
and  capabilities,  it is  horrendously slow!   It  is the raison
d'etre of microcomputers to have software that is interactive and
quick  responding  to the  user.  This  package  is certainly not
that.  Even  to process  the examples shown in the  documentation
(which, by the way, is excellent) takes enough time for you to go
have a  coffee!  Interpreted or pseudo-compiled BASIC is just not
fast enough to  handle this type of application.   I realize that
this  is  not  a spreadsheet  program but  it  lacks entirely the
facility  for  instant  'what-ifs'  that  makes  these  types  of
programs   so   usable   to  the   non-programmer.   I  was  very
disappointed in  MASTERPLAN.  I regret my purchase of it.  On the
other hand,  if we had a true compiler for BASIC then perhaps the
performance  of  this  package could  be improved.  Compilers are
available  for  the  other  8-bit  operating  systems  which will
greatly outperform an  OASIS BASIC program.  Why isn't  there one
for OASIS?  And what ever happened to the Pascal compiler we were
supposed  to have  in August?   Is it ever going to  appear?  I'm
sorry, Fred,  if this sounds like a lot of griping but this is an
open letter  to other users (and perhaps Phase One) and I do feel
like I have been 'had' with this MASTERPLAN package.

Well, I  have rambled  a bit  in this letter but at  least I feel
better now.   I was very disappointed to read the COMDEX issue of
Info-World and not find one mention of OASIS.  It sure seems like
CP/M has  the world by the short ones.  I am familiar mainly with
Radio Shack computers  (and there sure are a  lot of THEM around)
and subscribe to  two magazines which are published  for users of
the  Model  II.  Both  of them  are  actively promoting their own
favourite operating  system for  the II.  Once they sell  you the
operating system they will get to sell you all the 'improvements'

that should have  been there in the first  place.  No wonder they
aren't interested in reviewing OASIS.

Alas, I wax cynical  and now that I feel  bad again it is time to
close.

                        Be well and,
                        May all your parentheses be balanced,

P.S.
I got ZAP  finished sooner than expected and  have included it on
this  diskette.   I would  appreciate any feedback or suggestions
regarding any of the programs on this diskette.

1. We need  a general purpose BASIC converter - you know, from any other

it needs more work.  I think it can be used as the basis for programs to
convert other dialects with modification)

directory - again one that can be released into the OUG library.

10. We need  people who  can begin doing benchmark tests  of the various
software  products that  are becoming  available  - both proprietary and
public domain.

11. We need  lots more  applications to run against the  dictionary data
base.


13. WE BADLY NEED  A MODIFICATION TO SYSTEM.NUCLEUS THAT  WILL IMPLEMENT
THE BREAK  FUNCTION.  PHASE ONE hasn't been responsive to the pleas from
(at least) several members.  This may be hardware dependent.

14. We  need someone  to run  our dictionary through one or  more of the
other spelling checkers.  There are MANY misspelled words in the current
version of our word list, as well as many more non-words.

16. Boy do we need an "electronic spreadsheet" like VISACALC!

19. We very  much need a comparison of the features of the various major
operating systems (including OASIS, naturally).

20. We need  a  system  for  recording  and displaying  the  features of
commercial  software packages  - one  that I could send to  the software
developers for them to "fill out themselves."

21. Someone to  stay on top of all the new bulletin boards coming on the
air and to  give us an update of  the phone numbers and purpose of each,
etc.

22. A  screen  oriented  editer (like  Magic Wand  or  Spellbinder) - an
admittedly big task,  but probably doable even in  BASIC for anyone with
the ambition.

23. A  spelling  checker that  keeps track  of the words I misspell  and
automatically corrects them for me without making me look up the correct
spelling again and again and again each time.

24. A synchronous communication program.

25. People to search through other users groups libraries for worthwhile
things to  convert for operation under OASIS which we do not yet have in
the OUG library.

26. Compilers for "C", Pascal, Fortran, PL/1, Cobol, etc.

27. A grammatical error checker.

28. A fast assembly language SORT.

29. A list of the 500 most frequently used words in English writing
    for use with Chapman's new spelling checker.

30. A utility for automatically figuring out the optimum disk ATTACH
    values for HDL, STP, and STS for all of the different systems
    now operating under OASIS.

31. A generalized "25th line/prompt line" generator with fast cursor
    selection of options for execution of user programs/EXECs.

32. Major improvements to the way we introduce/review the contents of
    new volumes - alternatives to the VOLnn.EXECs.

33. New integrated way to find and use things in the OUG/personal library
    (a la APPLE/LISA) - beyond subject collections and CONTENTS files.

34. A CP/M emulator.

35. More demonstration packages of commercial software for our collection
    of those available to members.

36. More people to write articles about OASIS or letters to publications
    about such articles they have seen.  More press releases about your
    own OASIS compatible commercial software. Etc.

37.

THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAMS ON VOLUME 20.

***************************************************************


AMORT.BASIC

Yet another amortization program, but with a few new kinks that
definitely justify adding it to the library.  It was contributed by
it's author, Tom Papke.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

HNGPRIV.COMMAND

The CHNGPRIV utility is intended to change the privilege
level up to 7 (the factory level for OASIS).  It will enable
you to execute things like ACCOUNT from any account. No
source was provided.

Be careful with this very powerful routine... it isn't for
everybody, as it enables one to get inside of the nucleus,
and do all sorts of damage if you're not careful.

Tom Papke (213) 874-2394



TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

UMPDSK.ASSEMBLE
DUMPMEM.ASSEMBLE

DUMPMEM, allows you to dump any memory address to the console.
DUMPDSK, allows you to dump any disk sector to the console.
On both of them you enter a decimal number (memory address
or disk sector) or a 'C' (for cancel) and they will dump at that
point. If you make a null entry (no characters or non-numeric)
they will continue where they left off (upon entry they will start
at zero). The drive code on the disk dump is set by the first
parameter of the command line (default is S), ie. DUMPDSK A, will
dump sectors off drive  A.  Note that these programs do not allow
modification of memory or disk, they are therefore a lot safer than
upping your privilege level.  Bill Berne (206) 789-2888

â–¼ Only the ASSEMBLY versions of these two programs are included
because they are serialized for your machine number.  This in
itself is a valuable contribution because it shows how it is done,
and lots of you have been asking.  Be sure to also take a look at
the SERIAL.IZATION file Bill sent in for more thoughts on software
protection schemes.

You may assemble both of the programs either using the automatic
feature in this EXEC or by simply typing ASM DUMPDSK and ASM DUMPMEM
and then following the instructions on your screen.

TO TRY DUMPMEM NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

XPANDIX.BASIC

This is a slightly revised version of EXPANDI, a program for
expanding the size of an index sequential file, originally released
on Volume 11.  David Shirley had trouble making my original one
work and fixed it to meet his needs.  Try both versions.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

IXIND.EXEC
FIXINDEX.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND
MOVE.MACRO

This utility is used for fixing an invalid record count in an
indexed file.  The record count is maintained in the directory
entry block (DEB) for each file.  If several users are updating
the same file at once, the record count quickly gets out of synch.
An invalid record count is simply a nuisance in most cases.
However, it can be a serious problem if you are using the OASIS
Sort Utility, which assumes the record count is valid.  The
FIXINDEX program reads through the entire index file, counts the
number of records, and the updates the DEB.
from John Lapenta (315) 735-6421

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

AZERGUN.BASIC

This is a nifty little strategy game about trying to direct
"laser" bolts at an Unidentified Flying Object from outer
space. It's a little slow, but kept my interest for at least
a few minutes (might have been more inclined to play longer,
if I hadn't been working on getting Volume 20 out!).  It was
contributed by Jesse Josserand who I think wrote it.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

AMEIT.BASIC

This is a great pseudo-utility for generating new names of companies
and/or products from random selections of 48 prefixes and 48 suffixes.
List the program to see if your own company/product can be generated
from the current list.  This program can form the basis for many other
similar ones by just changing the contents of the DATA lines.  For
example, I'd like to see someone come up with a phrase generator for
writing nonsense technical sentences.  I'll bet you can think of other
even more interesting variations.  This program was contributed by
Tom Papke who converted it from an anonymous M-Basic version.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

THELLO.BASIC

This is the old classic game based on the Japanese game GO.  You
try to get the largest number of spaces covered by your markers
by capturing any of the opponent's  which you can bracket.  This
version was converted for OASIS by Jesse Josserand.  It is VERY
slow when the computer is deciding which move it wants to make,
and it wastes a lot of time re-painting the  display each time
instead of making use of the excellent OASIS direct cursor
addressing capability (a la HEXAPAWN, etc.).  If you have a mind
to do it, send us a rewritten version that runs faster.  It's a
great game of strategy - lots of fun to play.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

UG.CONTENTS

Gary Thompson wanted to print out the complete set of volume
descriptions (VOLnn.CONTENTS) in a nice format.  So, he put
this SCRIPT file together to tie it all together.  Be sure
you have a copy of all the VOLnn.CONTENTS files in your system
before trying to use this aid.

TO PRINT OUT ALL THE <content FILES NOW TYPE "RUN".
ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

ACK.COMMAND

This is a true disk(ette) file compaction utility that will squeeze
out all interfile spaces, moving it all to the end of the disk.  It
was contributed to the library by Han-George Juerges of DATASOFT in
Germany - Telephone (06181)253737 (he speaks fairly good English).
This is a commercial product donated to the library for your own use
and demonstration purposes only.  He has sold hundreds of copies in
Europe and would like to find some US distributors.  As a consequence,
no source code is provided.

I use it all the time and it is great.  It does occasionally leave one
block uncompacted for some reason with floppies, and it is VERY slow
with my 13 Mbyte hard disk - taking at least four passes of 10-20
minutes each to squeeze out most of the blank spaces.  This compares
with the Quantum Information "SQUEEZE.COMMAND" which does the whole
job in a little under ten minutes.  BUT! the PACK.COMMAND is three
times faster than SQUEEZE.COMMAND with a double density floppy
containing about 130 sequential files.  So, take you pick.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

ROOF.COMMAND

The saga continues.  This is the latest version of Bob Chapman's
spelling checker program.  It incorporates several improvements
that makes it faster and more natural to use.  Just replace your
old version with this one - it's better.  And, let Bob know you
like it sometime (416) 827-4173.  He tells me he hasn't had much
feedback from members who use it???  I use it all the time and
think its the greatest thing since peanut butter!

BE SURE THE NEW VERSION IS THE ONLY ONE IN YOUR SYSTEM.
TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

AIDER.BASIC

This is and OASIS version of the popular arcade game Space Raiders.
It was contributed by Jesse Josserand.  It is slow and the response
is jerky, but if you are in to shooting at spaceships while they
shoot back at you, you may enjoy this new contribution.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

ETCODE.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND
RETCODEX.EXEC

This utility allows you to set the Return Code to any value between
and 255 in an EXEC procedure.  It was contributed by
Gary Thompson of Design Systems (314) 391-0450

TO SEE SYNTAX TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

ERIAL.IZATION

This is a write up on a method to serialize software to the Oasis
Operating System. It is only one approach, use it as a basis for
serializing your own code, be original. I recommend that Phase One
use a similar tact within the nucleus and for important commands
such as ATTACH, etc. Bill Berne (206) 789-2888

TO SEE IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

HOOTER.BASIC

Another one of those shooting gallery type "action" games.  After
about two minutes fooling around with this one I figured out the
optimum strategy, so its greatest appeal is going to be for the
kids on a rainy day.  It was submitted by Gary Thompson and a note
in the program says it was written by Johnny Pumphandle.  Really?

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

NOOPY.BASIC

Another picture of my favorite hound dog, Snoopy.  I know we have
several others, but what the heck.  Besides, it was submitted by
one of our more active and creative members, Bob Chapman.

TO SEE IT AGAIN TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

RSDIR.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND
TRSGET.ASSEMBLE/COMMAND/NOTES

These are two programs for transferring files from Model II TRSDOS
diskettes to OASIS. The only other way I know of to do this is via
TRSDOS-->CPM-->OASIS. TRSGET allows you to do a direct conversion
without the expense of buying a REFORMATTER package. TRSDIR is a
utility which allows you to read the directory on TRSDOS diskette
and either display or print it. These programs function similar to
the GETFILE utility in that they only allow reading of the foreign
diskettes and do not do program conversions. As you are aware,
Microsoft Basic is not compatible with OASIS Basic and the programs
require further translation.  Robert Chapman (416) 827-4173

TO TRY TRSGET NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

NLOCK.ASSEMBLE/BASIC/BASICUSR/EXEC

We have decided to release to the OUG, a copy of a utility that
we have had lots of fun with called 'UNLOCK'. Get ready for this,
IT REMOVES 'READ' PROTECTION FROM OASIS PROGRAMS AND FILES!
Bet you'll have just as much fun with it as we have. Not to
mention the headaches it will save when you or some unknown
person 'accidentally' READ protects your files -- or worse
your entire disk.

Jesse Josserand, American Business Solutions Inc. (214) 484-8096

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

AP.ASSEMBLE/EXEC/NOTES
ZAP$.COMMAND

This is a disk sector modification utility similar to SUPERZAP and
called, appropriately, ZAP. It uses full screen editing and
is quite elegant.  It was written by Bob Chapman (416) 827-4173
one of our most professional "hobbyist" members.  I'll bet this
one is going to save somebody's rear end sometime when they find
that the only copy of a very important disk has gotten corrupted
somehow.  I haven't had any occasion to use it much, but it is very
easy to use.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

OL18FIX.EXEC

There was a catastrophic error in the VOL18.EXEC.  This EXEC
routine corrects it.  Copy it to the Volume 18 diskette and then
execute it.  It's automatic.

â–¼ ^

ELL, THAT'S  THE END  OF VOLUME 20.  LET ME  HEAR YOUR COMMENTS
ABOUT IT.   WE ARE  ALL STILL LEARNING AND I'M  SURE THAT THERE
WILL BE  MANY CHANGES TO COME. GIVE ME A CALL ANY TIME.
