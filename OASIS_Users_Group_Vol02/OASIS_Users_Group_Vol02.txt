16 May 1981

Dear Member:

Well, you got to Volume 2, so you must really be serious about
using your system.  Hope you are working on some original software
of your own to contribute to the library.  I'm constantly adding
things of my own to it as well as putting all of your contributions
into a common format and trying to make sure that they conform to
the KISS principle.

By all means send me anything you have, but try to make sure that
all of the KNOWN bugs are out, if possible.  Naturally, I always
prefer to see things in a generalized form that others will be
able to put to work without needing to adapt to drastically.  When
you can, try to think about the great variety of ways people may
try to use your software and make the human interface as natural
as possible.

I purged out the BASIC version of several programs and only left
the BASICOBJ and BASICCOM versions in.  That left a lot of extra
space, so I've included some of the information files that Phase
One Systems sent me.  You might want to take a look at some of
them.

All of you contributors take note.  We have had so many new
members join us who say they can't make any software contributions,
that I may be able to set a lower per volume money contribution
for those of you who are contributing software.  It depends
on how many new people sign up with only money contributions.  It
seems reasonable for them to subsidize those of us actually doing
all the work.  I'm not adverse to making special deals with people
who do special things to help the effort. We'll just have to wait
a while and see how the experience develops.  I intend to get a
reasonable compensation for all of the work I'm putting into this
thing, but if extraordinary amounts of money start pouring in,
I'll probably start doing some extraordinary things for the
members, too.

I have ordered a copy of the OASIS version of the Computerized
Bullitin Board System (CBBS) and expect to be making an
announcement of its availability in a few months.  Phase One
Systems will also operate their own bullitin board, but it is
going to be strictly service oriented.  So they are encouraging
us to proceed ahead with our own plans to implement one oriented
toward applications and information exchange.

That's all for now.  I never know how long it will be before you
see this - it could be a long time, I guess.

Peace,

FRED

THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAMS ON VOLUME 2.
SOME  WERE WRITTEN  BY THE  CPMUG  REVIEWER, "ZOSO." I'VE ADDED
OTHER COMMENTS WHERE NEEDED.

ACE.BASICOBJ/BASICCOM

PLAYS 'ACEY-DEUCY' (WITH NO PENALTIES FOR NON-WAGERING). IF THIS
HAS BEEN COMPUTERIZED, CAN THE FLIP OF A COIN BE FAR BEHIND? ENOUGH SAID.

IOPRINT.BASICOBJ/BASICCOM

WHEN FIRST I SAW THIS PROGRAM, IT PRINTED UGLY CURVES, IT WAS RIDDLED WITH
GROSS LOGIC FLAWS, AND IT WAS SLOW. I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO RESCUE IT. IF
THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM WAS STARTED ON CERTAIN DAYS, IT WOULD SKIP THE FIRST
SATURDAY IT ENCOUNTERED; IF STARTED ON CERTAIN OTHER DAYS IT WOULD SKIP
ALL SATURDAYS !! ALL OF THIS HAS NOW BEEN CORRECTED, AND IT NOW PRINTS PAGI-
NATED BIORHYTHMS WHICH ARE FAIRLY ATTRACTIVE, AND BY PLOTTING EVERY 24 HRS.
INSTEAD OF EVERY 12 HRS., THE THROUGHPUT OF THIS HAS BEEN DOUBLED. SINCE
I'M RATHER FOND OF THE WHOLESALE IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS PROGRAM, I'LL GIVE
IT AN 'A-'.   ZOSO

HAT.BASICOBJ/BASICCOM

THIS IS A PSEUDO-INTERACTIVE GAME IN WHICH ONE 'CONVERSES' WITH THE COM-
PUTER BY ANSWERING THE SAME QUESTIONS WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND THEREBY
GETTING A 'NEW' OUTPUT FROM THE PROGRAM. IF YOUR KIDS ARE OLD ENOUGH TO READ,
RUN ONE OF THESE AND ENJOY 30 MINUTES PEACE. ZOSO

HOMP.BASICOBJ/BASICCOM

THIS IS A CLEVER GAME WHICH INVOLVES THE LOGICAL ATTACK UPON
A COMPUTER GENERATED 'COOKIE' (SO HELP ME GOD). THIS GAME WAS PUBLISHED
EARLIER IN ONE OF THE COMPUTER MAGAZINES. THAT VERSION (MAGAZINE) WAS IN
A WORD, PITIFUL, BUT IT HAD INSTRUCTIONS. THIS REINCARNATION IS, BY
COMPARISON, EXCELLENT; HOWEVER, THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH DIRECTIONS TO ACQUAINT
A NEOPHYTE PLAYER WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS GAME. ZOSO

FOR ALL OF YOU DUNGEONS & DRAGONS PLAYERS OUT THERE HERE IS A NICE FORM

BIG DEAL, BUT CONVENIENT.

NVELOPS.EXEC and SUMMARY.EXEC

THIS WAS MY EARLY ATTEMPT TO AUTOMATE OUR MAILING LIST PROCESS.  IT'S NOT
SO HOT, JUST OK.  I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MUCH MORE SOPHISTOCATED THAT
WILL ACCOMODATE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PEOPLE - SOMETHING IN THE PUBLIC
DOMAIN, SO I CAN SHARE THE INFORMATION IN OUR MAILING LIST FILES WITH YOU.
THE ENVELOPS.EXEC PRINTS ADDRESSES ON ENVELOPS FROM THE SELECTED FILE OF
NAMES (eg NAMES.DEALERS, NAMES.INQUIRY, NAMES.MEMBERS, etc.) WHILE SUMMARY.EXEC
PRODUCES A LISTING OF EVERYTHING IN THE RECORD FOR EACH ENTRY.
IT DOES WORK, SO TRY IT.  FRED BELLOMY

ORMAT.EXEC
NOW THIS IS REALLY A USEFUL NEW UTILITY CONTRIBUTED BY JOE TRIMBLE AND
MODIFIED A LITTLE BY ME.  IT PROMPTS YOU THROUGH THE DISK(ETTE)
INITIALIZATION PROCESS.  YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT OASIS
TO USE IT.  YOU JUST ANSWER QUESTIONS AND IT SETS EVERYTHING UP.  THERE
IS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE MAINTAINANCE PROGRAM COMMING UP IN THE NEXT
VOLUME, BUT THIS ONE WILL, NO DOUBT, CONTINUE TO BE A FAVORITE. FB

UNDOUBTABLY, WHEN YOU GOT YOUR BASIC-E DISKETTES, THIS WAS AMONGST THE
'FREEBIES' THAT WERE INCLUDED. HANG.BASIC NOW WORKS. THE WORD YOU MUST GUESS
WILL BE TRULY RANDOM; BUT, BE HONEST, HAVEN'T YOU ALMOST MEMORIZED ALL

TO FIND OUT JUST HOW OVERWHELMING THE ODDS AGAINST WINNING THIS GAME REALLY
ARE, A SABBATICAL TO NEVADA IS RECOMMENDED. UNLESS YOU ARE DRIVEN BY FORCES
THAT YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN, YOU WILL PROBABLY GIVE UP BEFORE YOU HAVE EVER WON
EVEN TEN DOLLARS. IT SURE COULD USE A TRIO AND SOME SHOWGIRLS TO LIVEN
THINGS UP A BIT. ZOSO

HAPPENING.  TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT. FB

THIS IS AN ADVENTURE TYPE GAME ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN BYTE BY ROGER CHAFEE.
IT HAS BEEN ADAPTED TO OASIS BY JOHN TAYLOR.  AS JOHN POINTS OUT, IT IS A
FUN PROGRAM IN ITS OWN RIGHT, BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, IT WOULD BE A GOOD
STARTING POINT FOR WRITING NEW "ADVENTURE" TYPE GAMES.  THE MIND BOGGLES AT
THE POSSIBILITIES.  I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING A LOT OF INTERESTING NEW
GAMES OUT OF THIS - MAY WRITE ONE MYSELF. FB

ELL, THAT'S  THE END  OF VOLUME 2.  LET ME  HEAR YOUR COMMENTS
ABOUT IT.   WE ARE  ALL STILL LEARNING AND I'M  SURE THAT THERE
WILL BE  MANY CHANGES TO COME. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME EXTENSIVE
REFINEMENTS (LIKE THIS VOL2.EXEC) TO THE FIRST RELEASE OF VOL 2,
BUT ALL OF THE ORIGINAL PROGRAMS ARE STILL HERE AS IN THE FIRST
RELEASE, EVERYTHING JUST LOOKS NICER, NOW.  CALL ME ANY TIME.
