-----------------------------------------------------------------


Good Morning;


VOL36: Contains  some   really  heavy  weight  business  oriented
contributions  this  time.   It includes  a complete and original
Accounts  Payable  package  from Jim  Halpin, another utility for
converting BASIC  programs to BASICOBJ versions from Ross Hansen,
a nifty system for summarizing and displaying the characteristics
of  interrelated  files  from Harry  Schauwecker, a new ambitious
business  shell from  Peter Carlson,  and  a method for returning
control to a COMMAND after it's execution from Ross Hansen.

POLITICS: The good news  this time is that there  is no hot news.
Stability  seems  to be  the order  of the day at the  moment, at
least  as  far  as personnel  and relationships  among  the Oasis
companies is  concerned.  Everyone at Phase One is now part of an
apparently  effective  promotional  offensive.   The  IBM PC,  of
course,  is getting  a lot  of attention, but I have  been seeing
press  releases  for  for other  machines, too.   Looks  like our
earlier optimism may have been justified.

SOFTWARE DIRECTORY:  Phase  One  Systems has  announced a "bonus"
edition of the directory created specially for promotion of Oasis
on  the  Televideo computers.   The additional 10,000 copies will
carry  all  the original  software information and advertisements
(but will  have  all  the  original  hardware ads  replaced  with
information   about   Televideo  equipment).    According  to  my
calculations that  brings the  total number of copies printed  to
27,000.  Stue  Wachs at Phase One says they are offering the same
deal to  any hardware manufacturer who wants to play.  Looks like
an increasingly useful place to keep an up-to-date (FREE) listing
of  your  software  products  or  services.   They  are, however,
increasing the display advertising costs for the next issue - our
1/2 page (4X) went up 17 percent to $644 per issue!

"C" MANUAL:  Stue  reports  that  Phase  One  now  has  a  manual
available for Oasis "C".  Sorry, I don't have any further info at
this time.  Call Stewart Wachs, if you want one.  (415) 562-8085.

KAYPRO: I now have  unofficial word that Oasis is  up and running
on  one  or  more of  the Kaypro  machines...   and is available.
Apparently no formal announcement has been made by Phase One yet,
but anyone  interested in  a Kaypro with Oasis should  call Brian
Goodheim  at  Realsoft  Systems (303)  925-1558.  Other news from
Kaypro Corp (with Japanese tie-ins): they  have  reduced the list
price of  their bottom-of-the-line  Kaypro II from $1592 down  to
$1295  and  are  maintaining the  dealer margins.   The  Kaypro 4
remains at  $1995 and  the 10 Mbyte hard disk  Kaypro 10 stays at
$2795  -  still  some  of  the  lowest  prices  among  the  Oasis
compatible  machines.   Later  this  summer they  are planning to
unveil an IBM  PC compatible lap-size portable.  Wonder  if it is
going  to run  the  IBM  PC  version  of Oasis-16.   An  exciting
thought.

IBC: From  Randy Rogers  comes the  news that IBC now offers  the
best price  of all  on OASIS - FREE.  Oasis  is now included free
with all  IBC computers.   They are also bundling Sort,  Control,
Forms,  Multi-Calc,  and over  40 user friendly utilities.  Randy
also says that  the lead time for delivery  of the FAST 8MHz H.P.
Middies is way  down (and the reliability is  up).  "We make 8bit
Oasis run  faster than the 16bit Oasis.  IBC really does continue
to be the premier Oasis computer." says he.  I've seen nothing to
dispute  his   claims..........yet.   But,  there  is  a  lot  of
innovative  work  going  on out  there, so  who  knows what might
happen in the future.

ALTOS: Phase  One is  now delivering  copies  of Oasis-16 for the
Altos 586  and 986 machines; I confirmed it with both John Corwin
at Altos and Stue Wachs at Phase One.  From Altos comes more news
that  David  Hanna,  formerly  president  of  GRiD  Systems,  has
replaced  founder  Dave  Jackson  as  president  of  Altos.  Dave
Jackson remains chairman  of the board of directors  at Altos and
Hanna stays on  the board of directors at  GRiD.  The networks of
interconnecting  relationships  among  Silicon  Valley  companies
reminds me of the sociograms we studied in college.

IBM PC/XT: Phase  One did a big (24K) mailing to PC owner and has
been inundated  with inquiries  ever since.  There seems to  be a
LOT  of  interest  in  Oasis  out  there  in  PC-land.  They  are
beginning to pay  more attention to the PC-compatibles,  too, and
may  soon have  an announcement  about which ones really can  run
Oasis-16.  Stay tuned.

APPLE + Z80  card: With  all the Apples out there  and the recent
emphasis on  business applications of these machines, how come no
one has thought  about making Oasis available to  the hundreds of
thousands of Apple owners?  Seems like an opportunity knocking to
me ......  for someone.

UNIX SEND/RECEIVE: From  Scott Bouman of Quest Research we get an
announcement   of   a  new   software  package  that  provides  a
SEND/RECEIVE  link  between  Oasis  8bit  computers and  machines
running  UNIX  and/or Xenix  operating systems.  Suggested retail
price  is $359.   Scott  can  be  reached  at (612)  894-7752  in
Minnesota.

OASIS BASIC  ON  UNIX:  From UX-Software  of Toronto Canada (416)
591-8620 came  an announcement of another system which will allow
you  to run  Oasis  Basic  programs  under  UNIX.  They  call  it
UX-BASIC.   There  are quite  a few  differences  between the two
Basic dialects, but the conversion time no doubt would be shorter
than starting from scratch.

GAMES: Guess  what.  You  are not  the only one who likes  to see
games released  along with  all the other "serious" stuff  in our
library.  Several members (including some pretty "serious" types)
have told me  they really look forward to  a little light reading
once in  a  while.  And,  we do  have  a couple members who  have
confessed  to enjoying  the games  more  than the "useful" stuff.
The point of all this is to encourage you to go ahead and send in
those games  you think others might like to play, because you are
not alone.   It is true that most of our members want the bulk of
our library  to reflect the professional business nature of Oasis
and our  membership.  But, all work and no play makes Jack (sorry
Jack/John) a dull boy.

OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS: Nothing  new to report this time,  but I
can't  help  relating   a  story  that  has  a   BEARing  on  the
relationship of Oasis  to UNIX and the other  competing operating
systems.

At one point in  the adventures of two campers  they had to enter
Grizzly  bear  country.  Finally,  one of  them  stops and starts
putting  on some  running shoes.   The other asks, "What are  you
doing  that  for?"......"In  case  of Grizzlies."  was his reply.
"Surely you  don't think  you can outrun a grizzly,  do you." the
other quipped....."Don't have to.  Just have to outrun you."

Oasis doesn't have  to  outrun  all  the  big guys  like  UNIX or
PC/DOS.  We  just have  to outrun some of the  other little guys,
and Oasis is  an operating system with big  machine features that
makes it easy for us to do that!


Peace,

Notes to OUG:

On the inclosed  disk are  several programs.  CONVERT is a  quick
little exec  that  changes  a  'BASIC'  program  to  a 'BASICOBJ'
program. NOCSI: this program may  give someone  an idea of how to
retain  control  over  command program and make it return without
exiting to the CSI.

SPOOLER NOTES: Spooler  files may be unprotected by modifying the
"SPOOLER.LOADFILE"   program.    The   byte   at  0854H   of  the
"SPOOLER.LOADFILE"  program determines  the the protection status
of the files  created.  Modifying this byte from  24H to 04H will
unprotect  the  files  generated  by  the SPOOLER.   Use 'PATCH'.

Dear Fred:

It's good  to know  that  OASIS  is  alive  and well,  if  not in
Oakland,  then at  least among  the members of the User's  group.
I've spent the last two years developing some accounting software
for my  company using  OASIS, and I've always been  frustrated by
the lack of attention Phase One pays to its product.  I guess the
fact that Oasis lives on shows how good a product it is.

I first heard  of Oasis  in a Phase One ad  in Byte magazine.  We
purchased the single user version directly from Phase One back in
early 1982.  Since then the advertising has dried up, and now (as
I am  about to  market our product) I have  to convince potential
customers  that Oasis  is the  way to go; the response  is always
"What's Oasis?".

I wish I  had heard  of the Users group earlier,  because many of
the utilities  would have  saved me time in the  past.  I want to
get the entire back library (someday), but there is no room in my
budget right now.  If any of my contributions earn me credit, I'd
be  delighted to  receive any  of the volumes published before  I
joined.

As I  mentioned,  I've  written  a  group  of  accounting modules
designed   for   my  company   (a  mechanical  contractor).   The
accounting technique  is designed for a job cost environment, but
it  is equally  useful with  the job cost feature disabled.   The
programs are  the result of my experience as an accountant in the
manufacturing and contracting areas since I got out of school (in
1975).  I  want to sell these programs; my own market is strictly
local (New Jersey), so if anyone is interested, let me know.

The entire  package,  as  I market  it locally, includes software
installation, training,  source listings, file specifications and
users manuals.

The major modules are:

Accounts Payable       24 Programs     10 files
Accounts Receivable    23 Programs     19 files
General Ledger         21 Programs     17 files
Payroll                25 Programs     18 files
Job Maintenance         4 Programs      5 files
Vehicle Cost            1 Programs      2 files
Tool Inventory          4 Programs      3 files
Transmittals            7 Programs      5 files

plus many small applications (22 additional programs).

The modules are  quite flexible.  The Payroll, in  particular, is
useful in  our  industry  because  of  the way  it  handles Union
deductions.  For example, each Union can have 10 deductions, each
of which can be automatically calculated 48 different ways.  I've
yet to see a union deduction that the program couldn't handle.
The job cost feature has really helped my company get a handle on
work  in  progress.  The  up-to-the-minute job sales and itemized
costs are available  for display at any time,  with at most a ten
second file access delay.  Production people use that one program
constantly (more than the others combined).

I've included the  A/P module programs for use by the Oasis Users
Group members.  The source programs are included, but the program
documentation and  file specifications are not on this disk (they
are currently available, but as hard copy only).  These programs,
and  the   other  modules,  are  for  sale  only  through  Allied
Conditioning Corp.

Tell the OUG members:

DON'T SELL IT OR GIVE IT AWAY WITHOUT TELLING ME.

The software is  designed to  run on a hard disk.   We use TRS-80
Model  II and  Corvus hardware;  the screen is 79 columns  and 23
lines.   The  programs use  the Radio  Shack  function keys: 'f1'
equals control A, 'f2' equals control B, and BREAK equals control
C.

I hope  some of  the members  find the A/P system useful.   We've
been using it in two locations for well over a year, and while it
could  stand some  revision (always),  it  is reliable and pretty
easy to use.

The thing  that  most interests  me is  the  future of Oasis (and
Phase One).  Please include as much information in future volumes
as possible - what I've learned already is astounding!  Also, I'd
like to know more about Tim Williams: what is his background, why
the association with Phase One, etc.

If you have any questions, let me know.  Take it easy.

Dear Fred:

I  am  having a problem with my 5.6A version and perhaps you know
of a solution or possibly one  of  the other members can help me.

When  two terminals try to access tthe disk at the same time they
both get locked out and can't generate an interrupt. The only way
out is to reboot and in doing this on our  Altos  8000-12 we must
push the reset button a couple of times to get going.

I have written to Phase One also.  Hope the OUG can help out.

Sincerely,

OASIS/ALTOS SALES,,

Hello Fred..communicating  via CP/M  on a Morrow Micro, Anchor Mk
XII modem.   Micoramerica is having close out sale on ALTOS 8 bit
computers.   Example  8000-10  (4 user  10 meg winchester) around
$1000  dealer  price.  OASIS  Operating system around $350.  5-5D
around $1400.  16  bitters also on sale.  Also,  am getting Oasis
BB  software via  John Taylor,  and will probably put a  board up
soon on  one of  the ALTOS closeouts.  Keep up  the good work!!!!
By the way, Kaypro has finally a Z80A on their version 4, at $200
more.  Is this the OASIS unit?  Earlier KAYPROS used a 2.5KZ Z80,
and they were a lot slower.  So long for now..Bob

I understood, as of February `84, that Phase One was the supplier
of  16 bit  OASIS for  the Altos machines, even though  you could
only get 8-bit OASIS for their 5 inch machines from Altos!  Altos
is/was  waiting  for  something  called Nu-Age  BASIC, that would
allow one to run INTERPRETIVE OASIS BASIC under eunuchs.

Fred:
     Enjoyed vols. 33-35!  The RAMDISK is faster than my floppies
but slower than the slowest hard disk!  I gotta hand it to Chapman,
this RAMDISK is better than what I had before, but mainly it whets
my appetite for the $50 model.

     Also enjoyed the newsletter.  Especially the part about the
$180 1200 baud modems!  (notice that I'm calling you during the
week for the first time!)  Let me share with you what I learned in
â–¼ OL36.FEEDBACK:VOL36                                      02/01/85 11:13 Page 2

getting my Rixon T212A from United Products:

     1. Phone number you published told me to call 206-682-5025.
        THAT number was answered by Phil Clyde.  He sold me the
        T212A for $199.95 (he said the last batch of 80 modems,
        which was gone in 2 weeks!) was $180/modem, but they were
        older versions of the same model. (!?)

     2. Phil promised me the modem would work when I received it,
        or I could send it back.  He also said Rixon was super-
        helpful when it came to tech support, so I needn't be
        overly-concerned that no documentation would come with it.
        I got just enough help from them to make it a sporting
        proposition to figure out how to hook it up, but obviously
        I got it working now; I couldn't have done it without their
        help.

     3. Phil was happy to take my VISA charge card number over the
        phone.

     4. Just so others who may want to take advantage of this deal
        won't have to call all over the country like I did, here's
        what the thing needs to work:

          Female (digital signal) RS-232c
               1-chassis ground
               2-transmit
               3-receive
               7-signal ground
              20-DTR (MUST be high for modem to work)
                     (indicated by TR light on front panel)

          Male (analog (phone) signal) RS-232c
               7-one of the TWO MAIN phone wires
               8-the other main phone line (phones only need 2 wires)
              18-one end of a 9310 ohm resistor (that's what Rixon said!)
              19-other end of resistor (I used 10K ohm; works fine)
              21-one end of momentary SPST switch
              22-other end of momentary switch

To place call:
               1. Switch should be in open (normal) position
               2. Dial telephone normally
               3. Wait for carrier, then
               4. Close switch contacts
               5. Hang up telephone handset
               6. Release switch, you should be connected

Hints:
     -when modem is powered, but not connected to anything, the MC light
      should be lit.
     -when terminal (or SIOn) is connected, the TR light should come on.
     -pushing AL should allow you to "talk to yourself".  ie, echo will
      be provided as if a host were echoing back (or pins 2&3 were shorted)
     -once you reach step 6 (above), the SD light should flicker with
      each keypress, indicating the character is being sent.
     -the MC light will go ON if the carrier is lost!
     -press (in) the HS button for 1200 baud, let it out for 300.
     -make sure your SIOn baud rate is set correspondingly.
     -I ran pin 6 of SIO3 to pin 20 of Rixon, ENAB4 seems to work.
     -pushing in switches AL and ST should cause MC light to go off and
      stay off after a second or two

If Phil can't help the next poor soul who struggles with this, and the
above isn't enough, feel free to give him my number (even though Phil is
the one getting rich, he's quick to admit that he just sells them.)

I've been real busy lately, ESPECIALLY with all the new OUG software to
look over.  The STARTUP example (also from Chapman, I believe) was very
helpful in automating the set-up of the RAMDISK as :S, and SELECTX could
be a real life-saver one of these days!  I haven't even tried PROOF yet
(no source code - what gives?)  You mentioned that EXECLINK was tricky,
and suggested we look at some non-existent (on my disk) documentation.
All in all, I was very impressed with the goodies, and hope I can find
the time soon to send you the cleaned up versions of what you've already
seen, as well as two new commands: BELL & STRIP.  Do you return the disks
you receive from contributors, or will I be uploading the next batch right
from my Altos to yours?

By the way, who would you go to if you needed service on one of your
Altos' floppy drives?  (DMA just tried Altos, and they're now 0 for 1)

Remember when I told you that CARAVAN didn't return to the initial menu
from the message center?  Well, I think what happened was that when the
message part was terminated, it gave a terminal-sounding message to the
effect "THAT'S ALL FOLKS...  [hang up now]".  I think I hung up before
it returned to the initial menu!  Could you change the wording of that
message?

Speaking of changes, please update the Master OUG Members List to reflect
the proper spelling of my last name, as well as the modem change.

Well, that's all for now.  10 a.m. will come too soon as it is!!!

                                   -dave klotzman

PS: Finally caught up with Joel Laffitte (by phone) the other day.  He's
at Master Systems now (they're in the OASIS application software directory)
and he mentioned a cute trick that I'd like to pass along:

>LOAD BASIC OVERLAY1

>RUN QWERTYUX ; any file that won't be found

-             ; !!! you'll find yourself in the Basic editor,
                    with at least 5K more room than normally!
                    You can't run under the interpreter this way,
                    but you can Load, Save, and edit!

WISH LIST #36 - I wish somebody would ............. 15 March 1984
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

65. A  program  for  recording  and  analyzing a  tennis player's
performance.   Statistically evaluated  faults might help players
(like me) improve.

64. OASIS implemented on MANY more Z80 machines.

63. Programs  that   integrate  logical  groups  of  OUG  library
programs.

62. Someone to write reviews of the contents of the OUG Library.

61. A truly portable Oasis compatible computer.

60. A MOUSE input for CONIN to work with menu screens or windows,
together  with the  necessary software  to make it work with  the
keyboard (through an RS232C port?).

59. WASTEBASKET  routine  for  purging no  longer wanted files on
active  disks,  but  keeping  them  available  in  some  sort  of
"history" file(s) on a separate disk or series of disks - maybe a
modification of PURGE.EXEC.

58. I  need  faster  means  for  manufacturing new  volumes.  The
combination of INITDISK and BACKUP takes too long now.  How about
one command that does both functions in one pass?  I've been told
it can't be done!!

57. I  need a  simple information  system with which to file  and
retrieve notes about OUG members' needs and offerings, as well as
special  projects  information  for  ready  retrieval  to  answer
telephone inquiries quickly.

56. We  must   develop  a  networking  (LAN)  and/or  distributed
processing capability under Oasis.

55. Windows for running multiple applications simultaneously from
one terminal in multiple partitions.

54. I  need a  means for  QUICKLY making sure that all  the files
listed in an earlier SELECTED.EXEC still reside on the disk.

53. We need a  comparison chart showing for Oasis  Basic with the
others.

52. We need a method for RESTORING around a bad sector (or fixing
it) in an ARCHIVE file.

51. As we  begin to  get more people using Oasis-16  we will need
some new utilities  for moving things back and  forth between the
two versions.   In  particular,  we  will  need new  versions  of
SEND/RECEIVE (GIVE/GET??).

50. We  need  a diskette  format compatibility/interchangeability
summary.  8"  double density  and all 5.25" format diskettes  are
problems.

49. We need  class code source for any devices not now covered in
the library (see volume 18 and 34).

48. Someone  to  collect and  summarize information about all the
various commercial Oasis compatible software packages around now.

46. A set of indexes to all the Phase One OASIS manuals.

43. A utility for assigning synonyms for commands would be nice.

39. We  need the  compliment of  GETFILE  (PUTFILE?) for CP/M and
other formats.

38. The equivelent of  the BASIC PRINT USING "!"  for use in EXEC
routines.

36. More  people  to  write articles  about OASIS  or  letters to
publications  about  such  articles  they have  seen.  More press
releases  about  your  own OASIS  compatible commercial software.
Etc.

30. A  utility  for  automatically figuring  out the optimum disk
ATTACH  values  for HDL,  STP, and  STS for all of the  different
systems now operating under OASIS.

29. A  list  of  the 500  most frequently  used  words in English
writing  for use  with Chapman's latest spelling checker's CUSTOM
dictionaries.

28. A fast assembly language SORT.

27. A grammatical error checker.

26. Compilers for "C", Pascal, Fortran, PL/1, Cobol, ADA, etc.

23. A spelling  checker that keeps track of frequently misspelled
words and automatically corrects them.

16. An "electronic spreadsheet" like SUPERCALC!

From Jim Halpin  of Allied Conditioning Corp.  comes the accounts
payable module  of a  complete accounting system he designed  for
his   company.    Allied  is   envolved  with  manufacturing  and
mechanical contracting.
â–¼ ^
It is a  big system.   The data files require over  a megabyte of
disk storage.   The accounting  technique used is designed for  a
job cost  environment, but it is equally useful with the job cost
feature disabled.   Program documentation and file specifications
are available in hard copy form directly from Jim.  He is looking
for people to market the complete package for him.

ONVERT.BASIC/EXEC/INFO

CONVERT is a  quick little exec that changes a 'BASIC' program to
a 'BASICOBJ' program The main difference between the two types of
programs is in  the line numbering system.  To  convert a program
it is only necessary to load it, renumber it, then 'SAVE' it as a
'BASICOBJ'.  CONVERT  will do this globally, all *.basic owned by
the current  account or  .  to CONVERT all programs  owned by the
current account it  is only necessary to type  'CONVERT [CR]' the
program will  then  ask  you  if  you really  want  to do it.  To
'CONVERT' only  one program simply type 'CONVERT' and the program
name.  After it  has converted the program it  will automatically
compile it.

FILESPEC.BASIC/DOC/EXEC

This is a nifty program for keeping track of the characteristics
of interrelated files.  It provides for a consistant summary of
the specifications of files.  Contributed by Harry Schauwecker

you can see what typical output looks like, before actually using
the program.)

This is  an  Oasis  Business Shell  created by  Peter  Carlson of
Quorum Associates in  Tacoma, WA (206) 565-1700.  It  was written
to work in his environment on an Onyx system.  It will need to be
customized for your specific needs, naturally, but this will give
you a BIG head start.  I have not attempted to generalize it.  It
is presented pretty much as Peter sent it in except the names  of
the modules have  been changed to conform to  our standards.

OCSI.ASSEMBLE/INFO

NOCSI: this program  may give  someone an  idea  of how to retain
control over a command program and make it return without exiting
to the CSI. It is not for beginners as you must know what you are
looking for when  you set up the bias  factor and the location to
install a return instruction * only affects the program loaded in
memory **  It was  used as part of a  modem security program with
call  back and  attached a  special console driver that did  some
funny things at the bit level.

The syntax is 'START  NOCSI xx Cyy' where xx  is the port# and yy
is the class code.  *** SEE NOCSI.ASSEMBLE FOR MORE INFO ***
NOTE: I did not check this one out.  Too complicated for me. FB
