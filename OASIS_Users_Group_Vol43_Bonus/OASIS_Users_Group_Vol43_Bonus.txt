The OASIS Operating System was designed with four major ideas in mind:
 1)  OASIS was to be implemeted on micro-computers but have features
traditionally found on mini and mainframe computers;  2)  OASIS would be
implemented on machines from several manuffacturers;  3)  the micro-computer
market consists of mainly uninitiated computer users;  4)  programmers and
systems designers are accoustomed to having an operating system perform all of
the tedius tasks required on program development and execution.

Phase One Systems, Inc. of Oakland, California, the developers of OASIS, have
done a remarkably good job of meeting their original design objectives.

The purpose of this HELP routine is to provide summary information about the
OASIS Operating System and its utilities.  While it is not essential for the
casual user to be an expert with OASIS,  the more knowledge, the better.  The
OASIS documentation is excellent and you would be well advised to look through
it when you have time.  It is divided into ten major sections: SYSTEM, EXEC,
BASIC, DIAG, EDIT, SCRIPT, COMM, MACRO, LINK, and DEBUG.  Each of these major
facilities has many features/commands.  The following list summarizes them:

Welcome to Oasis
================


The Oasis User's Guide was  designed  to follow the natural order
of operations from the very beginning.  We have assumed that  you
are standing  in front of your new system, looking  at  the Oasis
Distribution Diskette, with a lot of questions as  to what  to do
^ext.  Relax, you're in good hands.  Every effort has been  taken
to make your learning experience as easy as possible.

The  system itself, both hardware and software, will be your best
teacher.  If you  are patient, and  follow the instructions,  you
will be well on your way to increasing your productivity with the
most powerful microcomputer operating system available today.



How to use this Guide
=====================

This User's Guide  has been written for  you -- the user  of your
new microcomputer  with  the  Oasis  Operating System.   We  have
arranged  the information on the  following pages so as to follow
a logical  progression of  what  you'll  need  to  know  to  make
effective use of your investment.  The language has been kept  as
simple  as possible, for  we assume that you probably don't  have
very  much  technical  knowledge  about  computers  or  operating
systems.

The purpose of this Guide is to give you the information you need
in a usable  form.  The  first four chapters describe the general
principles of  the Oasis  Operating  System  --beginning with  an
explanation of what  an  operating system is, and then describing
what it can do for you.

Chapter 5 covers the use of the Oasis TEXTEDITOR command, an easy
to  use, line-oriented  text editor.   The primary use  for  this
utility  is to  provide you with an  easy means  of creating  and
modifying EXEC job control language programs and System files.

The EXEC job control  language is described in Chapter 6.  Sample
EXECs and worksheets for creating your own  EXECs are included at
the end of the chapter, as are some suggested exercises.

The  second section of the Guide  begins with Chapter 7, entitled
"Getting  Started".  This  is is where  you  get to roll  up your
sleeves  and  actually begin working  with  Oasis  and  your  new
computer.
OASIS.GUIDE0:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:32 Page 3




Chapter 8 includes a series of procedures that tell you step
by step how to perform certain simple tasks.

System maintenance and error recovery guidelines  are included in
Chapter 9, together  with  procedures for  performing some of the
tasks that may become necessary.

Chapter  10  discusses  communications, both where  you  want  to
directly  link two computers together to exchange data,  and also
where you want your terminal to talk to another computer.

^

Throughout this Guide, we often refer you  to  other  sections of
the manual or to the Oasis System Reference Manual.  This is done
so that  you will know where  more  detailed information  may  be
found  if  you  wish to  do further  research into  a  particular
point.  Note that it is  not necessary  to  stop reading whenever
you encounter one of these references.

Also, whenever you see the symbol <CR>, it stands  for "press the
carriage RETURN or ENTER keys" -- not type < C R >

This Chapter  covers  a general overview  of the Oasis  Operating
System software, and is intended  as a beginning  introduction to
your use of Oasis.  It should be read and understood before going
on to the other  chapters of the  Guide as it  contains the basic
explanation for some important concepts as they relate  to Oasis.
If  you  thoroughly understand the  whole underlying process, the
various procedures will  be much  easier to visualize, understand
and use effectively.
^

1.1 The Operating System
========================

A computer system can be compared to a symphony orchestra in some
ways, for  both have a  number  of  separate parts that must work
together in order to produce useful work.   At any one  moment in
the  life  of  either the orchestra  or  the computer,  a lot  of
different  tasks  will be going on,  using different parts of the
whole system.  Sometimes, all of the parts will  be in  use for a
common task,  and  at other  times,  some  of the  parts will  be
inactive or resting.  The  coordination of  an orchestra requires
a  skilled conductor,  while  the coordination  of your  computer
system requires a good operating system.

Let's take a  closer  look at that orchestra.  Each instrument in
the orchestra has  a musician  assigned to play it.  The musician
will  "operate   "  the  particular   device  according  to   the
"instructions"  printed on  the  music  in  front  of  him.   The
musician will  also be paying attention to the Conductor, who may
issue commands  that  will affect  the way the  musician plays or
"executes" the music.

Likewise,  each device, such as disk  drives, printers, etc.,  in
your computer  system has its own "musician" that  is responsible
for  making the  device work.  The computer system's  "musicians"
are  called  device driver programs.  When the  musician  reads a
note,  his  fingers  move  to  a  pre-arranged  location  on  his
instrument;  when an  instruction is issued to a computer device,
the device driver causes certain  physical parts of the device to
be moved in a certain way.

For both the computer and the orchestra,  if  no  one coordinates
the activities of  the individual parts, no work or no  music can
be produced.   The selection  of  a Conductor or  of an Operating
System, therefore, can be very important.  You'll  find  Oasis to
be an exceptionally competent conductor of your computer system.
OASIS.GUIDE1:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:33 Page 3




The  most important part of Oasis  is called the NUCLEUS,  and is
stored in a file on your System disk called SYSTEM.NUCLEUS.   The
Nucleus is  a collection of instructions and routines that,  when
loaded into  the proper area of memory in your  computer  system,
"conducts" or directs the activities of the hardware parts of the
^ystem as a whole.  The Nucleus is loaded  or copied  into memory
by  a  procedure  called IPL, or  "booting".   The  IPL  (Initial
Program Load)  or  "boot"  process  is described  in  Chapter  7,
Getting Started.

Communication  between  you  and   Oasis  is  done  through  your
terminal,  using a  special  program which is  called the Command
String Interpreter, or CSI.  Oasis will  use the CSI  to  receive
your  instructions,  and  will then  use  the appropriate  device
driver programs  to carry  out your  wishes.   The CSI displays a
prompt on your terminal  screen that looks like a  "greater-than"
symbol: >  When you see  this  symbol in the far left  column  of
your screen, it means  that Oasis  is ready and waiting for  your
instructions.

These are the three main  parts  of the  Oasis  Operating System:
the   NUCLEUS,  the  device  drivers,  and  the  Command   String
Interpreter.

There is  another part of  Oasis  that closely  complements these
three  main elements.  This consists of a large  group of  System
Utility Programs.  System utilities are special tools for certain
system-level  operations.  In Oasis, system utility  programs are
called Commands, and there are over fifty different commands that
are included with the operating system.

Names of Oasis utility programs  are carefully chosen so that you
can  usually  tell  from just  the name what task the command  is
intended  to  perform.   An   example  of  an  Oasis  command  is
"FILELIST".  As the  name  would indicate,  this utility  program
will display  a  list of  all of  the files that you can  access.
Other examples include:

SHOW      Reports on the status of various devices.
COPYFILE  Makes copies of files.
BACKUP    Makes "backup" copies of disks.
RENAME    Changes the names of files.

etc.   If you  type HELP  when  you see  the CSI  prompt on  your
screen, and press RETURN, Oasis will display a list of all of the
available commands together with a short explanation of each one.
OASIS.GUIDE1:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:33 Page 4




1.2 The Oasis Environment
=========================

There  is much more  to Oasis than just the operating system  and
the commands,  just  as there is  more  to an orchestra than  the
conductor and the  musicians.   Oasis  was designed for  business
use,  with  a  few  very  important  design  considerations.   An
understanding of  the design purpose  and specifications of Oasis
is a good beginning to your use of the operating system.

First, a business  operating system  has  different  needs than a
^ystem designed  for program  development  or for hobby usage.  A
businessman purchases a computer  system and  software to  assist
in controlling and furthering  the business.   The  time required
to  learn  and  maintain  the  software  should  be  as short  as
possible, for  the businessman has better things to be doing with
his  investment.   Therefore,  a critical  design  feature  of  a
business  operating  system  is  its  ease  of use  by  unskilled
operators.  At  the  ideal level,  an  unskilled  end-user should
never see the  operating  system at all -- and this kind of power
and user friendliness was built-in to Oasis from the very  start.
The extensive HELP features are only the beginning.

Second, an orchestra needs music for the musicians to play, while
your computer  system  needs programs to  follow  so  that it can
perform  useful  work  for you.   In  order  to have programs, or
music, there first must be a  language  or a format for arranging
the instructions into readable, and executable,  form.  Oasis has
a full  range of languages that  can  be used  for an  incredibly
wide range of programming needs -- from  developing the operating
system itself through complex  business  management programs  for
nearly any type or size of company.

The capabilities  of these  languages are of critical  importance
to the  programmer, while the businessman  is  concerned that the
programs  be easy to operate and powerful enough to  get the jobs
done.  The  languages available  under Oasis, when combined  with
the features of the operating system itself, offer the programmer
the kind of power usually found  only on machines costing several
times  more than a microcomputer.  At the same time, the programs
themselves are easy  to transport  and  to  execute,  so that the
businessman is never forced to learn as much as  a programmer  in
order to operate the programs.

Oasis LANGUAGES:

Oasis has one of the finest versions  of the BASIC language as an
integral part of the operating system.  The same author who wrote
the operating system also produced the BASIC language interpreter
and  compiler  for Oasis.  As  a  result,  the full  power of the
operating system  can  be effectively  used from within  a  BASIC
program.
OASIS.GUIDE1:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:33 Page 5




The RUN and RUN2  commands are included as  standard  with  every
Oasis system.   These commands  are  all you  need  in  order  to
execute compiled BASIC programs.   Some computer systems have the
capability of effectively using the  re-entrant capacity of Oasis
BASIC; this capacity permits  all users on the computer system to
^se the  same  copy of the run-time module for greater speed  and
more memory area.  Check  your system's hardware documentation to
determine if this feature can be effectively used on your system.


The BASIC Programming package is a separate option for Oasis.  If
you  intend to  write  or  modify  BASIC programs on your system,
you'll need to get this optional package.  The BASIC interpreter-
compiler includes an editor, with full syntax checking, debugging
and  HELP facilities.   The Oasis  BASIC  compiler is  a  pseudo-
compiler; this means that a program is reduced to a p-code module
instead of to  machine language  during  the compiler  operation.
The resulting  p-code is used by the RUN  or RUN2 commands.  Note
that programs  may  be  run either interpretively or  as compiled
modules.  This permits a programmer to write the program and test
it  immediately  without having to compile  it  before execution.
After  the  new  program  has been  tested  and  "debugged",  the
programmer can then create a compiled version which will  execute
much faster.


Ryan McFarland  COBOL is also available for use with Oasis, which
widens  the  base of potential applications programs  that can be
used with your computer system.  RM COBOL is available on several
different operating  systems, but none of them offer  the kind of
power that the combination of RM COBOL and Oasis does. Both Oasis
BASIC and RM  COBOL programs can be run under Oasis  at the  same
time, and can even share files under some circumstances.

There is a version of the  C  language  that  is compatible  with
Oasis,  to further  extend  the  capabilities  of  the  operating
system.   This  version  of C was also  produced by the author of
Oasis during the process of writing Oasis-86.   It has since been
enhanced  and improved, and now  offers  full UNIX Version  7 "C"
compatibility.


There are other languages that have been developed or transported
to  Oasis by outside companies.  There  is a version of FORTH, as
well  as  a DATA-PLUS interpreter/compiler  for  running programs
developed on DATA GENERAL minicomputers.

To round out the high level language capabilities of Oasis, there
is a  very powerful  job control language called  EXEC.  The EXEC
language can  be used to produce programs so that an end user may
never  encounter  Oasis  directly -- all that  he  will see is  a
series of  menus  that  permit him to  take full advantage of the
power of Oasis.  This is an exceptional advantage, for  virtually
no training or prior  experience is  required of an  end user  on
such a system.  The EXEC language is covered in Chapter 6.

There  is yet  another language  capability  available for Oasis,
and  that  is the  Macro  Assembler, with  a Linker  and  dynamic
^ebugger.   Experienced  assembly-level   programmers  have  long
proclaimed the  Oasis assembler to  be the best  available on any
microcomputer  operating  system   --  and  often   superior   to
facilities found on mini-computers.  The  Assembler is documented
in  the  System  Reference  Manual.  We  have  not  attempted  to
describe  its  operation in this Guide, as the average user  will
not have much need for this information.  Note that the ASSEMBLER
is also  a  separately  available  option,  it  is  not  normally
included with your Oasis System.

OTHER FEATURES:

Other than the  languages,  and  the System  Commands,  there are
several other important  features  to the  Oasis Operating System
that set it apart from other microcomputer operating systems.

First, Oasis is both  a single and a multi-user operating system.
When  you first  begin using Oasis on  your computer, you  are in
single-user mode, with only one active terminal.  Using the Oasis
Commands, you  can set up and activate  other areas of memory and
other  terminals so that  several users can be executing tasks on
the computer.   Or, you can set aside areas of memory to be  used
for running tasks that do  not require operator supervision, such
as long report processing or printing.

Unlike other operating systems, there is virtually no differences
between  single user and multi-user  Oasis  programs  --  for the
necessary protections that enable safe multi-user access  to data
are  written  into Oasis.  The  applications programmer need  not
worry  about  making  sure that two  or  more users in  the  same
database  do not  damage each  other's  work or  data, for  Oasis
handles that issue very effectively.

Second, Oasis has  an extensive HELP  facility that safely guides
an inexperienced end-user through the performance of a variety of
tasks.  If HELP is typed at  the CSI prompt, Oasis will display a
list of all  of the available commands.  Type HELP  and then  the
name  of the command  as below to display  a list of  options and
syntax for a particular command.

>HELP (command-name)            (and press RETURN)
OASIS.GUIDE1:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:33 Page 7




The  Oasis  HELP command will tell you just  about everything you
might need to know in order to use any command, from the  precise
purpose of the command,  the  correct syntax, and a list  of  the
options  available  for  use  with  the  command.   This  feature
eliminates  the necessity for constant  reference to the  manuals
to check minor points.

^owever,  there's much more to being truly user-friendly than the
HELP command.   Powerful commands, such as ERASE and INITDISK are
equipped with  "fail-safes"  that protect the  unwary  from doing
unintentional operations.  For example,  if  you tried to use the
ERASE command to delete all files,  Oasis would automatically ask
you if each  particular file was okay to be erased.  Furthermore,
Oasis provides file  protections  such  as  delete  and/or  write
protection  which  will  prevent  a  protected  file  from  being
accidentally  erased.   Likewise, the  INITDISK command warns you
that  initializing a disk destroys any  files  that may  exist on
that particular disk -- and gives you two opportunities to escape
without completing the operation.

For the more  experienced user, the HELP  features and  failsafes
can be bypassed quickly and easily.


Third,  unlike  other operating  systems, Oasis has an  extensive
error message capability.  The operating  system  comes with over
100 built-in error messages, and  the texts of these messages are
very  descriptive.  For example,  if Oasis finds  that  it cannot
read  a part of a  disk, it will tell you "SECTOR NOT FOUND", and
will  also tell  you which sector it had difficulty with.  Or, if
the  disk  is  protected,  the  message  might read  "Disk  Write
Protected".

Most   of  these  errors  are   "trappable",  meaning   that   an
applications program can be  made intelligent enough so that, for
example, if you've  forgotten to set the printer  up, the program
can prompt  you to do so when the error  is discovered.  This  is
one   benefit  of  having  the  operating  system   developed  in
conjunction with an applications language.


Fourth,  the  Oasis  filing system  is also built-in,  instead of
being provided for by a particular language.  Oasis supports  six
different  types  of files,  including  2  kinds of  ISAM  (Index
Sequential Access Method), Direct and Sequential file types.  The
types and uses of  the  different files  are  covered  in Chapter
2.
OASIS.GUIDE1:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:33 Page 8




Fifth, Oasis has  a System Editor utility and an output processor
called SCRIPT.  Together,  these two  utilities  can make a  fair
word processor, especially  as the  Editor  has a  built-in  HELP
facility  all  its  own.   The  editor can  be used  for  program
development,  documentation and/or letters and memos, and is easy
to learn and use for such functions.  The full  system Editor and
Script output processor are included with Oasis on your computer.
 There is a limited, and easier  version of the EDIT command that
is also included.  This  command, called  TEXTEDIT, does not have
all of the power of the  EDIT  command, but it  is easier for the
new user to  learn.  Chapter  5 will  give you enough information
about the  TEXTEDITor to enable  you  to  use  it to  write  EXEC
^rograms or modify text files.

These are just a  few of the  features that give Oasis it's power
and  flexibility.   You'll discover  the  rest as  you  begin  to
actually  use  Oasis for yourself.   The  tools  and capabilities
that  make Oasis  such a powerful operating  system are the  very
tools  that  were  used to develop and maintain the system.  This
is rare  in the operating system software industry,  where larger
systems are usually  required  in  order to develop software  for
smaller configurations.


1.3  The Oasis Distribution Diskette
====================================

An  Oasis  Operating  System  Distribution Diskette  was included
along with the hardware parts of your Computer system.  For  now,
let's take a quick look at the diskette and the End-User  License
Agreement.

The Distribution Diskette contains the Oasis operating system and
its  commands  and  accessory  files  for use with  your computer
system. If you will look at the  diskette, you should see several
notations on the label.

The most important note on the label is your Oasis Serial Number.
This  number  is  very  important.   If  you  need  to  call  for
assistance, the Technical Support representative  of  your dealer
will  want  to  know  your  serial  number.    If   you  purchase
applications  programs for your  system, the applications program
dealer will  likewise need to know your serial number in order to
properly serialize his programs  for you.  You should make a note
of your  serial number, and  be sure to copy it  onto  any backup
copies you make of the Distribution Diskette.

The next  most important piece of information on the label of the
Distribution Diskette is the Version  and the  Date.   Your Oasis
Version will likely be 5.6  or higher.  Again, if you should need
to  call for  assistance, the  Technical  Support  representative
must have the version  level and the date your Oasis Distribution
Diskette was made in order to properly help you.
^ASIS.GUIDE1:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:33 Page 9




In Chapter 8, we will walk  you through the procedure of making a
safety copy of this diskette. You  should make such a backup copy
immediately, and afterwards use  only the copy  to  operate  your
computer system. The original Oasis  Distribution Diskette should
be safely  stored away from the computer, and not used other than
to make more backup copies if necessary.


Later on, in Chapter 7, you'll find a description of what happens
when  you  first  insert  this  diskette  into   your  computer's
disk drive.  This process is called "Booting", or IPL.


1.4  Your Oasis End-User License Agreement
==========================================

Your computer  dealer should have  had you sign an Oasis End-User
License  Agreement  form.   If  not,  you  should  ask  about  it
immediately.  The  License Agreement registers you  as the proper
owner of your particular serialized copy of Oasis.

The End-User License Agreement is very important to you.  It must
be  returned to the manufacturer of your computer, and from there
to Oasis Technologies, Inc.  When your  properly executed License
agreement   is   on   file,  you  will  receive   any   technical
notifications  that  apply  to  your Oasis Operating System.   In
addition, you will be able to get updates  to Oasis as  they  are
made available for your computer system.

1.5  The Oasis Reference Manual
===============================

The  Oasis  Reference  Manual,  written  by  Chris  Williams  and
published by  Phase One Systems, Inc.,  is an excellent source of
information about your Oasis Operating System.   Each  command is
carefully  described  with  all  of  its  options,  together with
examples   of   how  to  use  the  command.   If  your   computer
manufacturer  did  not  include a  copy of this manual along with
your  computer, you  may purchase  one from your dealer  or  from
Phase One Systems, Inc., of Oakland, California.

The  Reference   Manual  is  broken  into  appropriate  sections,
according to the topic being discussed.

You'll find that the Reference Manual is most useful when you are
looking  for some  specific  information about a  topic,  process
or procedure.   This  User's Guide  will  refer  you to  specific
places  in  the  Reference  Manual as needed  for  more  complete
information.  We recommend  that you read  the SYSTEM  section of
the  Reference  Manual  after  you've completely read this User's
Guide.  Oasis isn't as hard  to learn as it might appear, there's
just an exceptional amount  of power available to you -- and  the
more you learn, the more your system can do for you.

1.6  The Oasis Community
========================

There is  much  more  to Oasis  than just  the  operating  system
itself.   A closely  knit community of companies and  individuals
has grown together over the years since Oasis was first released,
and  now  offer significant  advantages  for Oasis  users of  all
types.

The Oasis User's Group, directed  by Fred Bellomy,  is located in
Santa  Barbara, California.   Their Post Office Box is #2400, and
the Zip  Code is  93120.  The User's  Group  maintains a  24 hour
bulletin board  which is open to members, and sends out  periodic
releases of member contributed software that operates under Oasis.
For further information, call 805-965-0265.


The Oasis Software Developers Association is a  group of software
authors  and companies who  manufacture software  for  the  Oasis
operating system.   Directed by Don Drew, the Association is open
to  authors  and   companies   involved  in   the  production  of
application software.   Computer  manufacturers may  also join as
associate  members.  The Association's telephone number  is  206-
644-7111,  and  the  address  is: The  Oasis Software  Developers
Association, 15606 Northeast  8th  Street, Bellevue,  Washington,

Oasis:  D I S K S  A N D  F I L E S


This  Chapter  describes  how  Oasis  handles   the   storage  of
information on disks and in files.

We'll  cover   disk   types,   layouts,   preparation  and  usage
suggestions, together with brief overviews of the  various  Oasis
commands that apply to disks.
^
Information  on  disks is stored  in  various arrangements called
files.  Oasis has several  different kinds of files that are used
for  different purposes.  This chapter  will explain  file naming
rules,  kinds  of  files,  preparing  files,  using  files,  file
protection and file  ownership.  Several Oasis commands  that are
designed for use with files will also be described.

The first Section of this Guide, which includes  Chapters 1-6, is
intended to give you  a thorough basis for your use of Oasis.  If
you read these chapters carefully, you should be well on your way
to becoming an effective Oasis operator.


The following pages will provide you with the general  things you
will need  to  know about  Oasis and  its relation  to  disks and
files.  Where  possible, more specific  and  detailed information
has been left to the System Reference Manual.


2.1  Disks
==========

There are two  basic types  of disks that you will encounter when
using Oasis: floppy disks, and hard disks.  Oasis generally  pays
no attention  to  whether a particular disk is hard  or a floppy,
for  the only  differences are  in terms of  capacity  and access
speeds.

(Some systems may have a third  type of disk,  called  RAM disks;
this  is an area  of memory that pretends it is a disk  drive.  A
RAM  disk will appear very  much like a hard  disk  drive, except
that a RAM disk is much faster.)

There  are several  common terms that  will apply to  all  disks,
regardless  of  type.   These  terms  include  Label,  Directory,
Cylinder, Track and Sector.  A brief definition of these terms is
given below, and a more detailed explanation can be  found in the
System Reference Manual.
OASIS.GUIDE2:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:33 Page 3




2.2 Disk Structure
==================

The usable surfaces of the disk are arranged in concentric rings,
called Cylinders.  You  may  often  hear  another  term  used  to
describe the rings on the  surface of a  disk, and that  term  is
"track".  All too often, these  terms are used interchangeably  -
and therefore incorrectly.

A track is a concentric ring around one surface of a disk.  Since
a disk  may have more than one surface  (especially hard  disks),
^he term "cylinder"  is  used  to describe the same ring  for all
surfaces of  a given  disk.   In  other words, a  cylinder  is  a
"stack" of tracks.   On a double  sided 8" diskette, for example,
data is stored on 77 cylinders  (numbered from 0 to  76).   If we
are only referring to one side of that diskette, we would use the
term  "track", if both sides are being discussed, the proper term
is "cylinder".

Cylinders and  tracks are further subdivided into sections called
Sectors.   The  number  of sectors per track may  vary, depending
upon the size of the  disk and its  capacity.  The  terms  single
and/or  double density are used  in  reference to  the number  of
sectors per track.  To  return to our example 8" diskette, single
density  means  there are  13  sectors  per  track, while  double
density diskettes have 26 sectors per track.


The  first track of a  disk  is  known  as  Track  0  (zero), and
contains the following information:

Boot loader program  (see Chapter 7.1 The IPL Process)

Disk Labels:   The  Disk Label is an eight character name that is
recorded in a particular place on the  surface of  the disk.  You
may choose  any name you wish for  a disk, except that the  label
must begin with either a letter or the dollar sign ($).

Allocation bit map: The allocation bit  map  is a  "map"  of  the
physical locations of sectors on  the disk surface, and a  status
indicator as to whether or not a given sector is in use.

Disk  Directory:   Every  disk  has  a  directory  that  contains
information about the  files that are  stored on  that particular
disk.  The directory records  the name of the  file, the physical
location on the  disk, the owner of the particular file, the date
the file was created or last modified, etc.
OASIS.GUIDE2:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:33 Page 4




2.2.1  Floppy Disks

Most computer systems usually  include an 8" or 5.25" floppy disk
drive in the system enclosure.   Diskettes for this drive  may be
formatted in  a variety of ways,  depending upon the capabilities
of the disk drive.

The most  common format  is  that of an 8" diskette  that  can be
formatted  in either single  or double density.   A single sided,
single density  8" diskette can be  read  by virtually any  Oasis
based computer system that has an  8"  disk drive.   Furthermore,
almost all such computers  can  read and  write on double density
diskettes as well.  This is a tremendous advantage of  Oasis that
^s not found in any other microcomputer operating system.

The 5.25"  diskettes  are unfortunately  not so inter-changeable.
For  more information on floppy disk  compatibility, see  Chapter
10; Communications.


2.2.2  Hard Disks

Oasis  treats hard disks much like  floppy diskettes, except that
the capacity is far greater and the access speed  is much faster.


Unlike a floppy disk drive, the Read/Write  head of a hard  drive
does NOT  physically touch the surface of  the disk.  Instead, it
floats a fraction of an inch above the surface as the disk spins.
This is a  very  important point, because  a hard disk won't wear
out as a floppy will due to the constant contact between head and
diskette  surface.  This factor  also contributes  to the greater
speed and capacity of a hard drive over a floppy.

The  exact capacity  of your hard  disk  will  vary  widely  from
computer  to   computer,  depending   upon   the   manufacturer's
specifications.   Note  that the  maximum  volume size for a hard
disk  is  16 mega-bytes.  If your hard disk is larger  than that,
you  may be able to split the capacity into more than one logical
volume.  See your hardware documentation for more information.


2.3  Disk Preparation
=====================

Before  a disk or a  diskette can be used by Oasis, it first must
be  prepared  through a  procedure  known  as  Initialization  or
Formatting.  The INITDISK command is used for this procedure.

The INITDISK command defines the tracks or cylinders and sectors,
sets  up  the  allocation  bit   map  and  establishes  the  disk
directory.  The disk label  is also assigned during this process.
Initialization  is  described  in  Chapter  8,  Procedures.   The
INITDISK command is covered in Chapter 4.
OASIS.GUIDE2:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:33 Page 5




2.4 Disk Usage
==============

You  must  always have at least one disk in operation in order to
use  Oasis, and that is your "S" or System disk.  When  you  boot
Oasis, the computer system will automatically look in a set place
for the System disk,  either to a particular floppy or  sometimes
to a particular hard disk.

After  Oasis  has been booted, you  may attach  other disk drives
for use if you wish.  The  procedure for  attaching a disk  drive
^s  described in Chapter 8, Procedures; the ATTACH command itself
is  described  in  the Chapter Four, Using  Oasis  Commands.   In
general,  however, the attach procedure  simply tells  Oasis that
you wish to use a particular disk drive, and assigns a letter (A-
G) for easier reference.

Oasis will  then get  the appropriate device driver for that disk
drive, if necessary, and load  it into memory.  This procedure is
known as "Attaching" a  device.  Note that this is an Oasis term,
it doesn't mean that your device should not be physically plugged
in or connected to your computer when not in use.  Oasis can work
with up to eight disks at a time, attached  as any letter between
A and G, plus the S drive.

The SHOW  DISK command is your major information source as to the
status of  your  disk drives.  This command  returns such  useful
information as:

The maximum capacity of the disk
The current space available on the disk
The size of the largest contiguous area
The number of files in use
The maximum number of files that can exist on the disk.

Note:

It  is generally not a good idea to use both floppy and hard disk
drives at the same  time for  for common  storage of programs and
data.  This is because Oasis will search all attached disk drives
for any  program it needs (unless you've specified which  disk to
search  when you issued the command), and floppy  drives are much
slower  than hard drives.  This  means  that the overall speed of
the system will be  slowed because of the slower access speeds of
floppy drives.

We  recommend that  you  only  attach  a  floppy  drive when  you
actually intend  to use that particular  drive.   At other times,
the drive should be left unattached as far as Oasis is concerned.
 This will permit greater overall  access times for your computer
system.
OASIS.GUIDE2:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:33 Page 6




2.5  The System Disk
====================

The System Disk, or the S disk, is always attached whenever Oasis
is  loaded  into your computer's memory.  Oasis will not let  you
detach this disk, although you may attach a different disk as the
"S"  drive.   If  you  attempt  to  detach  the  S  disk  without
substituting  another  in its place, Oasis will display  an error
message.  This is because the entire SYSTEM.NUCLEUS is not always
loaded into  your computer  memory.   When a part of  the Nucleus
that is  not  already  in memory is needed, Oasis goes to  the  S
drive to load in the part that  is required.  If  there were no S
^rive, the system would hang.

The  System  disk contains all of the files necessary for booting
Oasis.  A list of the minimum files that are required on a System
Disk is given in Chapter 8, Procedures.

Unlike other  operating systems, any disk  may be an Oasis System
disk if it has the required files on it.  There are no  specially
reserved areas on a System disk that  contain the elements of the
operating system,  for all of the  elements are  contained within
the various files.

Your computer system can usually be booted from either the floppy
or   the  hard   drive.   It  will  often  try  to  automatically
boot from the hard drive unless you interrupt the process in some
way.   The  most  common  method  of  interrupting  the automatic
booting procedure is by pressing a key on the Main System console
keyboard.

System disks,  in addition to the required files, usually contain
all  of the  various Oasis commands as  well, or as many  as  the
available space will allow.


2.6  Commands relating to Disks
===============================

There are  several Oasis commands that are intended for use  with
entire disks.  A list of the most commonly used commands is given
below, and more information is given in Chapter Four, Using Oasis
commands.

Command                 Function

INITDISK To initialize, or format disks
VERIFY   To check the functioning of disks
BACKUP   To copy an entire disk
ARCHIVE  To copy the contents of a large disk
         on to successive smaller volumes
RESTORE  To reload an ARCHIVEd disk
OASIS.GUIDE2:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:33 Page 7




2.7  Files.
==========

A file is  a  collection of individual records,  stored  together
under a common name.   These records can contain instructions for
a  program,  names  and addresses  of customers  and clients,  or
nearly anything else you might desire.

To  Oasis,  the information stored in files  is simply coded data
that is  located at a particular place on  the surface of a disk.
The information contained in a  file  can be  arranged in several
different ways,  according  to the way  this information  will be
^sed.   The  different  arrangement  patterns   are  called  file
formats.


2.7.1 File Names

Oasis refers  to files  by their names.  Each  file  will  have a
unique name,  from one to eight characters in length.  File names
always begin with a letter or the $ sign; this standard is called
a convention.  Each file also has a file type assigned to it that
is  joined  together  with  the  file   name.   The  same  naming
convention  applies  to  file types as does to names;  the  first
character of the type must be a letter or the $ sign.  File types
also may  be from one to eight characters  in length.   Each file
also has an address, or home  where  it resides.   This  home  is
usually located on a disk, although it could also be on a tape.

The combination of a filename, filetype and disk is called a File
Descriptor.

In general, you may choose the names  and  types that you wish to
assign  to your files.   However, Oasis has some rules concerning
file names and types; there are certain words which are reserved.
 This is because Oasis may look for a  file under a specific name
for a specific purpose.   If  some other file  has that name, its
contents  may not be what  Oasis needs in order  to carry out the
proper procedure.

2.8  File Formats
=================

Oasis  has  six  different arrangement patterns,  or formats, for
files.  The  format of  a file has  a lot  to do with the way the
file is intended to be used.  The six formats are as follows:

ABSOLUTE

This file format is used for machine  language programs that must
^e loaded into memory at a precise location in order to be  used.
The SYSTEM.NUCLEUS file is  in this  format.   Files of this kind
cannot  be  accessed or examined in any way  with  standard Oasis
commands.

Absolute files are sometimes called "coreimage" files in that the
file contents could be considered  an "image" of what  the "core"
memory must look like in order for the program to be used.


RELOCATABLE

This  file format is essentially the same as  an Absolute, except
that a relocatable file does not have to be loaded into a precise
memory address.  The  various COMMAND  files  are stored in  this
format.


SEQUENTIAL

The  records in a  sequential file  must be  read "in  sequence",
meaning  that in order  to  read record  #22 you must first  read
records 1-21.   Records  can  only  be  added to  the  end  of  a
sequential file, so if you wished to make changes to an  existing
record,  the  record is first  marked as  deleted and  then re  -
written at the end of the file.

The sequential file format is  the only  format under  Oasis that
allows the  file to "grow"  as  needed.  All  other file  formats
require  the size  of the file to be specified when  the  file is
first created.

DIRECT

This file format  is used  for records with  fixed,  or  standard
lengths.   The key to such records is their  record number.  This
kind of file requires that you specify the total size of the file
at  the time you create it.  An  example  of a direct file is the
SYSTEM.ERRMSG file that contains the texts  for all of  the Oasis
error  messages.  When  an  error condition  occurs,  Oasis  will
access this file to find the text that matches the error number.
^ASIS.GUIDE2:BONUS43                                      01/31/85 07:33 Page 9




You must specify the maximum  number of  records to be  stored in
this kind of file when you first create the file.   The disk area
allocated  or  reserved  for  this  file  format  is  contiguous,
meaning that it is all in one place on the disk.


INDEX

Commonly  known as  an  ISAM file  (for  Index  Sequential Access
Method), this format  is  used for  data  files  for  application
programs.  The records in an index file may be accessed  directly
(using a key) or  sequentially by reading the beginning record of
the file and so on until the desired record is located.

As is the case with direct files, index files also require you to
specify the  maximum  file size when  the file  is  created.  You
cannot later change  the size of  an index or direct file without
creating a new file and then copying the records  one-by-one from
the old file to the new.


KEYED

The format of a Keyed file also uses the ISAM specifications, and
is very similar to that of an Index file.  The difference is that
where  the  "keys"  to  the records in an Index file are  kept in
sorted  order,  the keys  for a keyed file  are  not  kept in any
sorted order.

For example,  the  records  in a customer  master file  might  be
accessed using the name of  the company as a "key".   If this was
an  Index  file,  the  names  would  be  in  alphabetical  order.
However, if  the file was  a keyed file, the names  would not  be
kept in alphabetical order.

2.9 Preparing Files
===================

Files  are created by Oasis in two ways, depending upon the  file
format you wish to create.

Various Oasis  commands, such as  TEXTEDIT, will create files for
you once you supply the name to be used.  These files will always
be sequential files.   For example, if you wish to create an EXEC
program, you might enter:

TEXTEDIT PAYROLL.EXEC      (and press RETURN).
^
Oasis would search for an existing file named PAYROLL.EXEC on all
of the attached disks.   If no such file  was found, Oasis  would
automatically create it for you.

Index or Direct files  must be  created using the CREATE command.
If your application program  requires the use of  Index or Direct
files, they  will usually be automatically created for you by the
application   package.   Check  your   documentation   for   more
information.


2.10  File Usage
================

The selection of a particular file format  will almost always  be
done  for  you  by  the programmer  who  wrote  your  application
program.  There are, however, a few things to  keep in mind about
the various file formats.

Access speeds:

For data  entry,  the keyed  format will  usually  be the fastest
since the new keys are not kept in sorted order. The index format
does keep its keys in sorted order, so the existing  keys must be
continually shuffled and shifted as new records are added so that
the keys remain in sorted order at all
times.

With both  index  and  keyed files,  you will  notice a  definite
degradation in access  speed when  the file  gets to  be over 70%
full.  This has  to do  with  the  way  that records are  located
within the file,  which is by a hashing algorithm.  If you notice
that  your data entry program  seems  to  be  taking  longer  and
longer, you've probably filled your  file past the 70% mark.  The
only  cure is  to  create  a new,  and larger, file and  copy the
records from the old into the new file one by one.

Note that this slowdown will also occur if the file has ever been
more than  70%  full.  It doesn't  help  to  simply delete enough
records to bring the total number below the 70% point.

2.11  File protection
^====================

There are three forms of protection that can be  applied to files
under Oasis: DELETE, WRITE and READ.  These  can be applied  when
the file is created, or afterwards  by  using the RENAME command.
DELETE and WRITE protection can also  be  removed  by  using this
command.  The RENAME command is described in  Chapter Four, Using
Oasis Commands.

DELETE

DELETE protection, as its name implies, stops the file from being
erased.   It  also  prevents  the file  from  being  renamed to a
different file name.

A potential problem may occur with a DELETE protected  file if it
is a text file, because when you re-edit a text file and save it,
the old  copy is renamed  filename.BACKUP --and this will not  be
permitted on a DELETE protected  file.  This example  illustrates
the  point that  file protection may work against  you as well as
for  you.   For this  reason,  we recommend  that  you  carefully
consider what  protection  a  file might  require,  and how  that
protection may affect normal usage of the file.

WRITE

A WRITE protected file can be deleted, but not written-to.  WRITE
protection   is  often  used  on  files   containing  information
that is used  by a number of different programs where the data in
the file is not to be updated.


READ

A READ protected  file may only be accessed from a BASIC program.
This type of protection is  most  often used on files  containing
sensitive data, and is applied to make sure  that only the proper
programs may access the file.

READ protection should be applied with care, because once you put
it on, you can't take it off.

2.12  File Ownership
====================

Files have owners, and only their owners may erase them or rename
them.

Each file entry in a disk directory includes an  owner-id number.
If no accounts have been implemented on your Oasis system, all of
the files will be owned by the SYSTEM account, and their owner-id
numbers will all  be  zero.  Such files  are called public files,
and any user may access them from any partition.

If  accounting has  been  implemented on  your  system, then each
file's owner-id number will  correspond to  the account-id number
of its owner.  Files  with an  owner-id number  greater than zero
are  called private files, and  may be accessed only  if you  are
logged onto  the proper account,  or if the file  has been marked
to be shared with your account.

Remember  that  the  file ownership is indicated by  the owner-id
number, and NOT  by the name of the  account that owns them.   If
you copy your files  onto a  diskette, and  intend to  take  that
diskette to a  different Oasis  system, you'll need to change the
ownership of the  files  on  the  diskette to  the System account
before  you make the transfer to the other  system.  This is done
so as to make the files  public instead  of private,  for you may
not know what accounts might exist on  the other system,  if any.
Read Chapter Three, User Accounting, for more information.

2.13  Commands relating to files
================================

There  are several Oasis commands that are designed for use  with
your files.  The most important of these are as follows:

COMMAND                 FUNCTION

FILELIST To display a list of your filenames
LIST     To display the contents of a file
COPYFILE To make a copy of a file
RENAME    To change the name  of a file, or apply or  remove file
         protection.
ERASE    To remove files
OWNERCHG To change the owner-id of a file or group of files.

See Chapter Four, Using Oasis Commands for more information.  The
Oasis Reference Manual  also  describes the syntax  and usage  of
these commands together with examples.
