Dear Member;

The highlights of  volume 15  include Vince Oster's new utilities  for
maintaining  the  spelling checker  dictionary files, Paul Schindler's
Phone Billing  program and  a sort routine for Trimble's  mailing list
program; the Accelerated Cost Recovery System sent in by the Cannon's;
Ron Brubaker's tutorials for generating Class Codes and his lessons on
various sort  algorithm  usage.   Some  of  the games  sent  in by Tom
Carolyn Cannon are nice, too.

My wife, Tomoko, and  I spent four weeks in  June and July touring the
U.S.  It was  a great business/pleasure trip that  gave us a chance to
meet many of you along the way.  Everywhere we went I tried to call as
many of  you  as possible,  but of  course  most of you were  also off
enjoying  yourselves as  well.  So,  our  schedules often didn't mesh.
When we did make contact it was great.  I got a first hand opportunity
to  see  what you  are doing  and to discuss future planning  - really
valuable for me.

A number of  you have  asked me about investment related  programs for
use with  the stock market, etc.  I have finally gained access to what
looks like a possibly good set of programs written for the TRS-80 (mod
I or  III).  We  need a team effort here.   First, we need someone who
can evaluate  the value  of the programs from the  book: "New Uses For
The Home Computer  In The Stock Market" by  Thomas V.  Lenz.  Then, if
they still look O.K.  to someone who knows about these things, we need
someone who  can take the TRS-80 tapes or 5.25" disks and convert them
to either  CP/M or  OASIS 8" single density disk  format.  Finally, we
need people  who will go through each program and translate the TRS-80
BASIC  code to  OASIS  BASIC  statements.   So,  now is  the  hour for
volunteers.  How 'bout it?

Very soon I  will be releasing a "PRESS RELEASE SYSTEM" that will make
it easier to send notices out to people on mailing lists (in general).
I am  attempting to get Phase One to let us use their list of computer
related journals, but even if they don't give it to us we will put one
together one  way or another.  If you already have such a list, please
send  it in  and save  me a lot of time  finding and keying in all the
data.  Along this same line, if you have any other interesting mailing
lists already keyed, consider letting us put them in the library.  You
will find  one  such list  in volume  15:  a list of many  other Users
Groups.

O.K. you guys, someone out there must be capable of putting together a
better sort using  Ron Brubaker's stuff.  The Trimble  Sort works, but
we all  know there are MUCH MUCH faster ways to sort files.  How about
some bright student  of all you faculty members  making a term project
out of it?   There must be some way  we can get a "commercial quality"
sort into our library.  Can we buy the rights from someone?  Any other
ideas?

Next volume will  include a  narrative listing of the contents  of all
volumes up  to and including volume 16.  Many people have asked for it
and  I must  confess that  it is a very convenient  reference to have.
Likewise,   you   might   consider   listing   to   the   printer  the
DISKFILE.LIBRARY so that  you have an alphabetic listing  of all files
and their volume designations.

We still very  much need  someone to run our dictionary  files through
one of the other spelling checkers to find as many of the non-words in
ours  as  possible.  While  their presence  in  our dictionary doesn't
seriously  detract from  its utility,  they do take up space  and slow
down the operation of the spelling checkers a little.  How 'bout it?

Don't forget to consider  using things in the library  as patterns for
new applications.  Our  library is now chuck full  of great ideas just
waiting for  someone to change things a little in the code in order to
create totally  new applications!   And, don't forget to send  in your
new programs, whether totally new or just new adaptations.

Discussions with  many  software  developers continue  about both demo
packages and  limited capability versions of their commercial packages
for inclusion in either the OUG library itself or a separate series of
demo  disks.   So far,  lots of  people have indicated an interest  in
testing the  ideas, but as yet we still don't have a "first one." I'll
keep you posted on this one.  It has great potential for everyone.

On our recent trip  we took pictures of many  of you.  It really helps
to remember more  of the details of a  visit to have a picture to look
at.  It might seem a little corny to exchange pictures, but I'd really
like to  tie faces to some of your voices when you call.  In the early
days when we only had a few members and even fewer who were contacting
us,  it was  easier to  keep names and voices sorted  out.  Now, it is
getting to  be  nearly impossible.   So, if  you  will send me one  of
your's, I'll  send  you  one  of  mine.  No  big  deal.  Just a little
something to keep this growing monster a little more personal.

In connection with my  recent decision to make subject  collections of
the library available,  I am preparing a series  of EXECs to summarize
each catagory.  So far, I've got them for the BUSINESS/FINANCE, GAMES,
and the  SPELLING CHECKER  collections.  Soon, there will be  ones for
the UTILITY, ENGINEERING/MATH, and EDUCATION/MISC.  There will also be
one  that  ties  the whole  bunch together.   These  new EXECs will be
useful for  anyone who  has the complete library as  well as those who
just get a particular collection.  They will be augmented periodically
as new stuff is added to each catagory.

Thanks to Rod Proctor  I am now able to  use OASIS version 5.5 with my
Digital Microsystem  DSC-2.  At  the moment one of the  disk drives is
out in  the second  computer, but will soon be  fixed.  That means the
Bulletin  Board  project  will be  getting more  priority  in the near
future.  My personal  (secret) goal is to have  it working in time for
the November COMDEX  meeting in Las Vegas this  year.  We'll see.  I'm
way way behind  in getting stuff integrated into  library volumes, and
that still really  must have higher priority.  Guess  I shouldn't have
taken such a long vacation this summer.  But, it was soooo much fun.

Oh yes, I've  decided to  start giving you every THIRD  volume free on
you  standing  order.   Hope this  will help  some  of you to continue
justifying support  of OUG  efforts.  And, don't forget to  suggest to
your buddies/customers/associates that they consider joining the OUG -
with a  standing order using a copy of your earlier volumes as a giant
head start, cost saving measure, if necessary.  We really do need more
standing  order  members, because  these are  the  people who are kept
up-to-date  about OUG  happenings, problems, opportunities, etc.  (not
to  mention  financial  support for  OUG).  Non-standing order members
will get newsletters  and other information from OUG  only on a highly
irregular basis!

Well, that  will  about  do it  for this  volume.   You may be getting
volume 16 with this one as it is almost ready to go, too.

DEAR FRED:

I RECEIVED  VOLUME I  OF THE  OASIS USERS GROUP RECENTLY, AND  I'M
GLAD TO BE A MEMBER OF THIS ORGANIZATION.  I AM FAMILIAR WITH MOST
OF THE  GAMES,  SINCE  MOST  APPEAR  TO BE  BASED  ON THE CREATIVE
COMPUTING  "BASIC   COMPUTER  GAMES"  BOOK,  PROGRAMS  I  HAVE  IN
MICROSOFT BASIC.   YAHTZEE  IS  EXCELLENT,  BUT  I WAS  UNABLE  TO
RECOMPILE AWARI  FOR 5.5 (IT MENTIONS A "FOR WITHOUT NEXT" ERROR).
HOW ABOUT  ADDING "RANDOMIZE" TO YAHTZEE FOR A DIFFERENT GAME EACH
TIME?


THE REASON  FOR THIS  DISK LETTER  IS TO ENCLOSE 1 OF  MY PROGRAMS
WHICH MAY  BE OF  SOME USE TO OTHER MEMBERS.   MOST OF MY PROGRAMS
ARE FINANCIAL OR ACTUARIAL IN NATURE, TOO ESOTERIC FOR THE TYPICAL
USER, BUT COMPINT.BASIC COULD BE HELPFUL TO SOME.

COMPINT.BASIC IS  A PROGRAM  WHICH WILL GENERATE COMPOUND INTEREST
FUNCTIONS  INCLUDING  PRESENT  AND  FUTURE  VALUES  OF  ANNUITIES,
AMORTIZATION  SINKING FUND  FACTORS, AND ACCUMULATED OR DISCOUNTED
VALUES.  ENTERING 1  AS THE AMOUNT WILL GENERATE  VALUES AS CAN BE
FOUND IN  PRINTED  COMPOUND  INTEREST  TABLES  OR BY  ENTERING  AN
AMOUNT, THE  INTERMEDIATE STEP  OF MULTIPLYING CAN BE SAVED.   ANY
NUMBER OF COMPOUNDING  PERIODS PER YEAR ARE ALLOWED  AND ANY RANGE
OF YEARS  CAN BE DISPLAYED.  NOTE THAT THE OPTIONS SPECIFY WHETHER
THE PAYMENT FOR  AN ANNUITY (REGULAR PAYMENT) IS  AT THE BEGINNING
OR END OF EACH PERIOD.


I HOPE YOU  WILL FIND THIS PROGRAM USEFUL ENOUGH TO ADD TO THE OUG
LIBRARY.   I WILL  GRATEFULLY ACCEPT ANY CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM ON
SAME.  IT IS "HOPEFULLY" SELF-DOCUMENTING ENOUGH WHERE THE AVERAGE
USER WON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE WITH IT.


I WOULD ALSO  LIKE TO  GET A VERSION OF AWARI  WHICH WORKS IN VER.
5.5.

IT WOULD  BE  NICE  IF SOMEONE  WOULD WRITE/CONTRIBUTE OTHELLO.  I
HAVE SEEN A GREAT PROGRAM FOR IT WITH DIRECT CURSOR ADDRESSING AND
ITS A GAME THAT CAN BE PLAYED BETTER ON A COMPUTER THAN A BOARD.

ONE OTHER  ITEM  OF  INTEREST FOR  OASIS USERS  CONCERNS  THE WORD
PROCESSING PROGRAM WORDSTAR, WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST
AVAILABLE.  MY  COMPUTER VENDER RECENTLY HAD A DISCUSSION WITH THE
PRESIDENT  OF  MICROPRO  AND IT  APPEARS THAT  THEY  HAVE WORDSTAR
OPERATING UNDER OASIS  IN HOUSE, BUT THEY HAVE  NO PLANS TO MARKET
IT  BECAUSE  THEY FEEL  THE MARKET  IS TOO SMALL TO WARRANT  THEIR
SUPPORT OF THE PROGRAM.

IF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER  OF OASIS USERS WERE TO  REQUEST IT WITH A
COMMITMENT TO  PURCHASE, IT MIGHT SWAY THEM ENOUGH TO CHANGE THEIR
DECISION.  I NOW RUN SPELLBINDER ON OASIS AND WOULD GLADLY TOSS IT
OUT IF  WORDSTAR WAS  MADE AVAILABLE.  POSSIBLY A SURVEY  OF OASIS
USERS WOULD INDICATE ENOUGH OF A MARKET FOR MICROPRO TO REEVALUATE
THEIR POSITION.  I SOLICIT YOUR COMMENTS IN THIS REGARD.


 BEST REGARDS,

Dear Fred,

I know  its  been ages  since I  last sent you something and  if I
don't  start contributing  more  I  won't  be  able to  afford  to
continue subscribing to OUG.  Thus, in spite of a crazy schedule I
am firing off this disk in the hopes of keeping up a bit.

First a question.  As  you have probably observed I  tend to write
most  text  files as  SCRIPT files.   I have formatted all of  the
script  files on  this disk  to be displayed on a  terminal.  What
format would  you prefer for the submission of text files?  I find
SCRIPT  type files  to  be  the  most  flexible since  it  is only
necessary to change the .SIZ command to reformat them for terminal
display  or  for the  preparation of  hardcopy  on the printer.  I
trust that you  will make whatever adjustments are  necessary this
time and I will try to comply next time with your wishes.

I believe that your desire for some thoughts on writing class code
routines has  yet to be satisfied.  I'm afraid that what I have to
contribute may not be of much help if all you are looking for is a
class  code for  your Tektronix  Graphics  terminal.  I don't have
such fancy toys to play with.

However, I   am   including  two   class  codes  I  have  written.
Both are revisions of the ones Phase One released that didn't work
with my equipment.  CLASS7A is for my Televidio 920C  and  CLASS3A
is for my ADM-5.

I should also mention that the University's ADM-5 is equipped with
a Retrographics  board that supposedly is compatible with (believe
it or not)  the Tektronix Graphics codes.  Unfortunately  I am not
an assembly language programmer so I'm not sure if I can lick this
one.  My  listing  of  the  Oasis  CLASS MACLIB  file  has several
terminal  types  that  appear  to  be  nearly  as  complex as  the
Tektronix terminal  so it  may be doable.  Maybe you  could enlist
the aid of one of the talented Z80 assembler types in the group to
look into this one for us.

I'm afraid  I must  add  my  dissenting  vote  to those  who  have
indicated  their lack  of joy  over the decision to include  Oasis
BASIC programs  on the OUG disks as BASIC type files.  However, to
show  you  what a  good sport  I am I have included  several weird
programs I  wrote  to  deal  with  this problem.

Finally, one  bit  of unfinished  business.  I  know  I said I was
working on  some sorting routines but you guys are talking about a
whole different kettle of bits than I was.  I'll confess, I bought
one of those $100 jobs (QISORT) to do the type of file sorting you
keep  talking  about.  What  I have  been working on is much  less
ambitious.   I  have  written,  in  Oasis  BASIC,  several sorting
algorithms  such  as  the  infamous  "bubble sort",  the legendary
"Shell sort", and a variation of the "quicksort" algorithm.  After
some  fooling around  I have  gotten familiar enough with each  of
these that I can modify them for sorting either numbers or strings
using either a direct sort or a pointer sort.  I have even written
some lessons on how these things work for a class I teach in BASIC
programming.  If there  is interest in such mundane  stufr,    I'm
glad  to  send in  a copy, but if you are going  to expect a slick
version like QISORT you are talking to the wrong guy.

Ok, I'll  risk  one  more misunderstanding.   I have recently been
offering a  short series  of workshops on Oasis for  members of my
faculty  and  staff.  I  have written  several  handouts that were
intended  as  an introduction  to several  parts  of the operating
system  including  the  Command String  Interpreter, EDIT, and the
special features  peculiar to Oasis BASIC.  I have assumed that my
audience has  worked with  a computer of some sort  previously and
that they  already know BASIC.  If you are interested I can try to
eliminate some of the references that are specific to the hardware
we  have  at the  University  and  get  them  in condition  to  be
submitted.

Dear Fred:

We want  to  compliment you  on the  fine job you have been  doing
coordinating the users  group.  We know it has  been a lot of hard
work as well  as a lot of fun.   The improvement in quality of the
programs in  the library  and the newsletter lately has  been very
noticeable.  Keep up the good work.

As to your  comments in a recent volume about the need to get more
publicty for OASIS we can only say: Bravo!  As commercial software
people we  constantly are faced with the question "What is OASIS?"
It seems  most people in the micro industy still feel that CP/M is
the only  operating system available.  It is up to those of us who
have an  interest in  promoting OASIS to do something  about this.
We  have  taken your  suggestions about  sending  news releases to
trade magazines we  subscribe to.  Perhaps you could  distribute a
list  of names  and addresses  of all those publications you  know
about.  We  are sure  there are other people like  us who are only
aware  of the  publications they  receive.  I recently had a  long
conversation with Terry Benson at Interface Age and suggested they
ought to give more coverage to OASIS.  I also suggested an article
comparing   the  advantages   of  the  various  operating  systems
available  would  be  most  informative  for  readers.   If  other
memebers of  the OUG would write them and other publications maybe
we  would begin  to  see  more  mention  of OASIS  than  just "The
manufacturer also  offers the  OASIS Operating System", as is  the
usual comment accorded us in most trade magazine articles.

By the way, we appreciate the change you recently made to send all
programs in the BASIC form.  As we are using an Altos ACS-8000-15D
running  multi-user,  our  maximum memory  available is about 45K.
Some of the earlier programs in the library could not be loaded on
our machine.   I would recommend that everyone contributing to the
OUG remember  that not  all systems in use out  there have as much
capacity as  their own systems.  It is very frustrating to try and
load  a program  to make  modifications only to find that  we have
"insufficient  memory".   Sending things  out in the BASIC version
has helped solve this problem.  We also find that many people seem
to add to  the length of their programs  with many unnecessary REM
statements.  This may just be a difference in philosophy about the
way to  write a program, but we find that removing most of the REM
statements  means  we  can load  a program  that  otherwise is too
large.

Also, if  you ever  find out  how to get the OASIS  communications
working on  a DSC-2 under 5.4 or 5.5, please let us know.  We have
a user  with a  similar configuration to your own  system and have
been trying  to get  help with that problem for  about six months.
It is too bad that certain manufacturers offer the OASIS operating
system and then cannot or will not support it.

That's about  it  for  now.   Hope  you  find  these  programs  of
interest, and keep up the good work.

WISH LIST - I wish somebody would.......................................
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

1.  We need a general purpose BASIC converter - you know, from any other
BASIC (like BASIC-E) to OASIS BASIC. (NOTE: We now have MCONVERT, but it
needs more work.  I think it can be used as the basis for programs to
convert other dialects with modification)


3.  We need to develop a cheap way for members to call the new OUG Bulletin
Board computer.  Does anyone know a way to use the networks (ie TELENET,
TYMNET, etc.) or other phone service for cheap "off hours" communications?

6.  We need a conversion routine for converting ASSEMBLY language code
from other Z80 systems to OASIS.

7.  We need a BASIC disassembler.

8.  I need a comprehensive mailing list program for keeping track of all
our members - one that we can put in the public domain.
Thanks for all the contributions on this on. Still don't have what I
want yet.  It needs to operate with SCRIPT as well.

9.  I need a data base system for maintaining the commercial software
directory - again one that can be released into the public domain.

10. We need people who can begin doing benchmark tests of the various
software products that are becoming available - both proprietary and
public domain.

11. We need lots more applications to run against the dictionary data
base.


13. WE BADLY NEED A MODIFICATION TO SYSTEM.NUCLEUS THAT WILL IMPLEMENT
THE BREAK FUNCTION.  PHASE ONE hasn't been responsive to the pleas from
(at least) several members.

14. We need someone to run our dictionary through one or more of the
other spelling checkers.  There are MANY misspelled words in the current
version of our word list, as well as many more non-words.

15. We need a systematic way to keep track of the CLASS Codes and Device
drivers - like an alphabetical list by device names with names of drivers.

16. Boy do we need an "electronic spreadsheet" like VISACALC!

17. We need a utility that compresses out multiple interfile spaces on
a disk and frees up one large contiguous space.  Probably a tough task.

THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAMS ON VOLUME 15.

***************************************************************


ACRS.BASIC

This program computes depreciaton schedules based on the new
tax laws.  It is very useful for real estate people and
personal investment decision analysis.  The program allows you
to enter headings and names of customers and agents if you want
to print the schedule out for someone.  This was adapted from a
program and article that appeared in the March 1982 issue of
Interface Age.  It was submitted by Tom and Carolyn Cannon.

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

SCIISET.BASIC

This is a dandy new utility by Ron Brubaker which just prints out
a table of the ASCII character set.  If you are anything like me,
you need one every now and then and have to search all over the
place to find the last publication in which you can remember seeing
one.  So here it is once and for all.  Note: it prints the actual
character your output device uses for each actual ASCII value.


TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

ASICCOM.EXEC

Companion to Ron Brubaker's BASICOBJ.EXEC.  This one compiles the
whole batch of BASICOBJ programs he converted from BASIC versions.
It can, of course, be used with any disk containing BASICOBJ programs.
I put it together after seeing Ron's efforts.  FB

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

ASICOBJ.EXEC
OBJBASIC.BASIC

I created this pair of programs for those diehards out there who
still insist on having all of their BASIC programs as BASICOBJ's.
BASICOBJ.EXEC is a procedure that makes a list of the files of
type BASIC on the input disk specified utilizing the command
FILELIST *.BASIC:&A (FILE where &A is a variable in the EXEC
routine. BASICOBJ.EXEC then calls the BASIC program OBJBASIC
which I have supplied as a BASIC file (I try to please). OBJBASIC
then writes another EXEC procedure which will execute the BASIC
interpreter, load each file that was previously listed, and resaves
the file as a BASICOBJ type file on the specified output disk drive.
The original EXEC then calls this new EXEC and does the job. Finally
the damn thing cleans up after itself. I'd almost bet that there
is an easier way to do this but this works (slowly).

THIS IS A COMPLETE SERIES OF LESSONS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS OF
SORTING ALGORITHMS.  IT WAS PREPARED BY RON BRUBAKER (312) 534-6899
FOR A CLASS HE TEACHES IN BASIC PROGRAMMING.  IT IS EXCELLENT AND
INCLUDES FOUR EXAMPLES OF EACH OF THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SORTING:
BUBBLE SORTS, SHELL SORTS, AND QUICK SORTS.  IT TAKES SOME TIME TO
GO THROUGH ALL OF THE LESSONS, BUT IT IS GREAT STUFF.  TRY IT.

LASS3A.ASSEMBLE
CLASS7A.ASSEMBLE

CLASS7A.ASSEMBLE is a  modification of the Oasis distributed class
code  7 for  the TeleVideo  920C.  I found that there  are several
differences   between  my   terminal  and  what  was  provided  in
SYSTEM.CLASS7 on my operating system.  I believe that I have fixed
all of these in the version I am submitting.

I have also  been working with an ADM-5 at the University.  It has
several features not  found on the ADM-3 for  which Oasis provides
SYSTEM CLASS3.  I also found that class code 3 does not correspond
exactly to the  ADM-5 on a couple of  input translations.  Thus, I
finally  got  around  to  writing  CLASS3A  ASSEMBLE  to get  this
terminal working the way it should.  I am also including this file
in case anyone else can use it.  Ron Brubaker (312) 534-6899


TO ASSEMBLE THESE NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

OMPINT.BASIC

THIS IS A PROGRAM WHICH WILL GENERATE COMPOUND INTEREST FUNCTIONS
INCLUDING PRESENT AND FUTURE VALUES OF ANNUITIES, AMORTIZATION & SINKING FUND
FACTORS, AND ACCUMULATED OR DISCOUNTED VALUES. ENTERING 1 AS THE AMOUNT WILL
GENERATE VALUES AS CAN BE FOUND IN PRINTED COMPOUND INTEREST TABLES OR BY

LASCODE.LESSON

Ron Brubaker has put together some helpful notes on the generation
of new class codes.  This is an excellent step toward a more highly
automated "system" for generating class codes - which we still need!
But, this helps.  So, thanks Ron.  (NOTE: This is a SCRIPT file.)

These programs are used for maintaining the OUG spelling checker(s)

file segments, SPELLING.SIZEnn.  DICTFIX is used for deleting "wrong"
or unwanted words from the dictionary (and BOY does it need weeding!).
The DICT modules are called by the others.  The EXECs tie everything
together.  These were submitted by Vince Oster (605) 342-8455.  I've
used both of them and they work fine under OASIS Version 5.5, but I
had trouble under 5.4B (not sure what the problem is).

SC2$FIX.EXEC

THIS IS A PATCH TO OASIS VERSION 5.5 FOR THE DIGITAL MICRO SYSTEMS DSC-2.
PREVIOUSLY, SIO3 AND SIO4 WOULD NOT WORK PROPERLY - COULD NOT BE ATTACHED
WHEN WE CHANGED FROM VERSIONS 5.4B TO ANY LATER RELEASE OF OASIS.
THE SOLUTION WAS DISCOVERED BY ROD PROCTOR (206) 881-6191 AND I HAVE VERY
GREATEFULLY CHECKED IT OUT ON MY OWN DSC-2.  ALL IT DOES IS CHANGE THE
SYSTEM.NUCLEUS LOCATIONS, 2BB0 AND 2BB7, FROM 3A TO DB.  BUT, THAT LITTLE
CHANGE MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD!

This EXEC might form the basis for other PATCHES you want to submit.  At
least you wouldn't have to start from absolute ground zero.

ABELS.EXEC/ONE$UP

This is a routine I wrote to print labels from the various mailing
lists (eg. MEMBERS.ADDRESS and UGROUPS.ADDRESS).  It asks for the
name of the mailing list and the runs the SCRIPT file LABELS.ONE$UP.
It's not fancy at all, but it is the one I use all the time as of
right now.  FB

TO TRY IT NOW TYPE "RUN" ELSE HIT THE <CR> TO CONTINUE:

ISTOBJ.EXEC and OBJLIST.BASIC

LISTOBJ.EXEC is an EXEC procedure similar to BASICOBJ.EXEC that is
intended to  make the  task of listing a large  number of BASICOBJ
type files  to the printer a simple chore.  I must admit that this
is  one of  the advantages  of the choice of the  BASIC file type.
However,  most of  my programs  are saved as BASICOBJ files  and I
intend to  continue this  practice.  Thus, I have whipped  up this
delightful  pair  of  routines to  do the  chore  of listing large
groups of such files without overexerting myself. Ron Brubaker

AT THE END OF THE MONTH TO EITHER BILL CLIENTS OR ALLOCATE COSTS.  FOR
THOSE CLIENTS REQUIRING DETAIL BILLING, WE SIMPLY SEND THEM A COPY OF
THE PRINTOUT. I BELIEVE THE PROGRAM IS SELF-EXPLANATORY.  ONCE IT HAS
BEEN USED, IT CREATES A FILE CALLED "PHONE.CALLS" AND ANOTHER CALLED
"PHONEC.BACKUPC" WHICH CONTAIN CALL DETAIL INFORMATION.  I USUALLY
BACK UP ONCE A WEEK OR SO, JUST IN CASE "PHONE.CALLS" GETS BOMBED.
