15 April 1984

Hello all ye faithful;

This is one of two special bonus volumes released with volumes 36
and  37.  There  is so  much stuff (about 3 regular  SSSD volumes
worth - about 750K) that I am trying something new this time.  As
you  have  obviously  discovered, these  files were  sent  in the
ARCHIVE format.   As a  convenience to those few of  you who have
floppy  only  systems,  I have  broken the  material  up into two
batches of about  400K each and ARCHIVEd each  separately so that
the  RESTOREd  files will  not occupy  more than some of you  can
handle on your single available floppy.

BONUS37A: contains  commercial  software  demonstration  packages
from three of our members: BPGEN from Bob Bortz, QISORT from Bill
Berne,  and  DATEBOOK  from  Michael Hobach.   These packages are
generally self explanatory.  I must confess that I have not spent
as much  time as is usual with the regular OUG library volumes in
checkout  and  augmentation  inorder  to make  them bullet proof.
Hopefully, you will  not have any trouble with  them.  If you do,
be sure to  call the authors or companies  envolved and not me in
these cases.

The bonus volume labeled  BONUS37A also contains a repeat  of the
new spelling checker  dictionary files that were sent  out on the
volume 33  bonus along  with another copy of the  latest spelling
checker program,  PROOF, also previously released (volume 34).  I
have done this  mostly because we had room  and because I thought
it would be  convenient to have everything together  in one place
rather  than scattered  around various volumes.  (NOTE: These two
bonus volumes  represent a  complete copy of the latest  spelling
checker system and is an EXTRA special bonus for those of you who
established your standing order after volumes 7-9!)

BONUS37B: The rest  of the  new spelling dictionary files are  on
the  second  bonus volume  labeled BONUS37B  -  these are the the
missing dictionary files you have been waiting for.

Finally, if you have trouble handling this ARCHIVE format for any
reason,  please  let me  know.  Otherwise,  I'll  probably use it
again.


Peace,

Fred Bellomy
