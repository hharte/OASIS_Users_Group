Dear Member,

Well here it is: Volume 6 and it's another good one.  We have some really
serious software contributors out there in OASIS land. You will note some
significant changes starting with this volume.  First, and most important,
we will only include the BASICOBJ version of BASIC programs from now on to
save space.  To compensate, two EXEC's will be repeated on every volume:
COMPILE and a new one, RUN$.  RUN$ will allow you to "RUN" BASIC programs
through the OASIS Interpreter.  Instead of saying RUN CIVILWAR you can say
RUN$ CIVILWAR even though you haven't yet compiled the program.  I hope
all of you pros out there will be patient with those of us who still need
such crutches.  To get a compiled version that will run on your particular
release of OASIS you can just type COMPILE CIVILWAR after you have put the
BASICOBJ version on a disk that has vacant space on it (Of course you can
also type BASIC CIVILWAR and do the same thing, but perhaps our EXEC will
be a little less confusing for some people.).

A somewhat more subtle change is that we are beginning to run out of games,
or more accurately, we are starting to get more serious contributions from
members.  Nearly every day I get a call from someone who promises to send
us more serious software.  There is a lot out there.  Even relatively new
OASIS users are doing unique things that they are willing to share with the
rest of us.  It's great and exciting for me!  Our BUSINESSMASTER II project
now has 4 partners working on the conversion: me; Stu Rosenthal of Green
Lawn, NY; Ed Kempf of Olathe, KA; and Bill Anderson of San Francisco, CA.
My guess is that we should have this complete business system available in
a month or two.  It is not public domain, but I purchased a dealership for
the OASIS USERS' GROUP and every member will be able to acquire a copy under
the same conditions as other volumes in the library.

A couple of you have told me that you have either put "ads" in your local
bulletin boards or are thinking about it.  Thanks, and I encourage others of
you to do the same thing.  It's one way to get in touch with other OASIS users
in your area, and the more members we have the better - both financially, and
program contribution-wise.  Remember, I have no objection to several of you in
the same geographical area getting together and sharing the OUG library volumes
with each other as long as you don't "sell" anything and collaborate with one
another in putting together quality contributions to the library. Always keep
in mind that there is a lot of intellectual energy and time envolved at my end,
and one way or another it is important that I continue to be compensated. We
all clearly want this thing to continue on indefinately and that is personally
my intention.

Now for the really BIG news.  Digital Microsystems of Oakland, CA and I are
finalizing an agreement to set up the OASIS USERS' GROUP BULLETIN BOARD on
one of their computers!  It could happen anytime now.  I have John Taylor's
version of the CBBS for OASIS and have checked it out on my present system.
There are still a lot of things to do, but the ball is rolling.

Phase One has indicated that they would be in attendance if we hold a USERS'
GROUP meeting at the Fall COMDEX in San Francisco, so I am starting to put
together the plans for that.  Your input is strongly encouraged.

What else?  I'm still having a ball and enjoy talking to all of you who call.
Sorry I can't always answer the technical questions, but soon we will have an
organized list of members and you should be able to find someone in your area
or with your interests on the list.  I guess that's all for this volume.

Oh yes.  I got stuck with 10 boxes of WABASH double sided double density,
soft sector diskettes.  The guy who sold them to me didn't tell me they were
not flippies and has refused to talk about it.  Anyway, if you know anyone who
uses double sided 8" diskettes (one index hole), have I got a deal for them.

WISH LIST - I wish somebody would.......................................
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

1.  We need a general purpose BASIC converter - you know, from any other
BASIC (like BASIC-E) to OASIS BASIC.

2.  Jim Mc Cord in Santa Barbara wants to run a version of UCSD PASCAL
under OASIS.

3.  We need to develop a cheap way for members to call the new OUG Bulletin
Board computer.  Does anyone know a way to use the networks (ie TELENET,
TYMNET, etc.) or other phone service for cheap "off hours" communications?

4.  We now have a few inquiries from people who can't use 8" floppies.  We
need members who can convert to other media formats to form sub groups of
the OUG so ONYX users and others can get access to the public domain stuff.

5.  We need a clearly written proceedure for setting up new class codes.

6.  We need a conversion routine for converting ASSEMBLY language code
from other Z80 systems to OASIS.

7.  We need a BASIC disassembler.

8.  I need a comprehensive mailing list program for keeping track of all
our members - one that we can put in the public domain.

9.  I need a data base system for maintaining the commercial software
directory - again one that can be released into the public domain.

10. Etc.

JOE TRIMBLE WORKED UP THESE FOUR LESSONS TO HELP PEOPLE AT HIS OFFICE LEARN
HOW TO USE OASIS SCRIPT.  THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN THE TEXT THAT APPLY ONLY
TO HIS PARTICULAR SITUATION, BUT I THINK THERE MIGHT BE OTHER PEOPLE WHO
CAN BENEFIT FROM WHAT'S HERE IN ITS PRESENT FORM, SO HERE IT IS.

BE WARNED THAT IF YOU ASK TO SEE IT NOW, IT'S GOING TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO
SEE ALL OF THE FOUR LESSONS.

THIS IS THE 5 HIDDEN NUMBER/COLOR GUESSING GAME. IT IS A REAL CHALLANGE
AND I ONCE TOOK A FULL HOUR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST NEXT MOVE.  THE
FRIEND I WAS PLAYING WITH REMINDS ME OF THAT ONE MOVE EVERY FEW MONTHS OR
SO.  ALL IN ALL, IT'S A FUN GAME.  I MADE MANY MODIFICATIONS TO AN
ANONOMOUS PROGRAM AND ADOPTED IT TO OASIS. FB

THIS IS THE LONG AWAITED LINK WITH ALL OF THE CP/M BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEMS
THAT ALLOW DOWN LOADING OF SOFTWARE.  WITH THIS PROGRAM YOU CAN TALK DIRECTLY
WITH THE XMODEM OR MODEM PROGRAMS AT THE OTHER END RUNNING UNDER CP/M.  IT
WAS ADAPTED FOR OASIS BY JOHN TAYLOR FROM ORIGINAL SOFTWARE CREATED BY
WARD CHRISTENSEN.  JOHN HAS INCLUDED BOTH AN ASSEMBLED VERSION (COMMAND)
AND THE SOURCE CODE, PLUS VARIOUS FILES FOR CUSTOMIZING THE PACKAGE FOR
YOUR PECULIAR HARDWARE.  HE HAS ALSO INCLUDED EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION
WHICH YOU CAN SEE NOW, IF YOU WANT.  IN ADDITION, HE INCLUDES A RECENTLY
UPDATED VERSION OF THE LIST OF CBBS SYSTEMS THAT OFFER SOFTWARE TO ANYONE
WHO WANTS TO CALL IN.  YOU MIGHT CHECK THE LIST TO SEE IF THERE ISN'T A
SYSTEM IN YOUR CITY.  THIS IS A RELATIVELY EASY WAY TO GET PUBLIC DOMAIN
SOFTWARE FOR CONVERSION TO OASIS COMPATIBILITY.  TRY IT. IT'S NOT AS
DIFFICULT AS YOU MIGHT THINK.

THIS IS A SLIGHTLY REVISED VERSION OF THE SAME PROGRAM RELEASED EARLIER.
THIS VERSION LETS YOU SPECIFY A KNOWN POSTAGE AS WELL AS THE WEIGHT OF
THE PACKAGE.  I WROTE IT IN DESPERATION WHILE TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT
COMBINATIONS OF STAMPS TO PUT ON ALL OF THE VARIOUS PACKAGES OF DISKETTES
I'VE BEEN SENDING TO YOU ALL. FB

IF THE RECIPE IS FORMULATED TO SERVE 4 PEOPLE AND YOU WANT TO MAKE THE
SAME RECIPE FOR 7.68 PEOPLE, THIS PROGRAM TELLS YOU WHAT THE NEW AMOUNTS
OF EACH INGREDIENT SHOULD BE.  BOUND TO BE A REAL WINNER.

WELL, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DECIDED NOT TO SPEND THE HUNDRED BUCKS FOR THE
FAST OASIS VERSION, HERE IS ONE THAT WORKS ON MOST FILES.  IT WORKS JUST
FINE ON ALL THE TEST FILES I TRIED IT ON.  IT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN BY
JOE TRIMBLE AND I'VE MADE A FEW CHANGES TO MAKE IT EASIER TO USE.  BUT,
JOE GETS ALL THE CREDIT FOR THIS ONE.  I KNOW A LOT OF YOU WILL THANK HIM
WHEN YOU SEE HOW WELL IT WORKS. IT IS SLOW WITH LARGE FILES, BUT THEN IT'S
FREE, TOO!

BETTER PLAN TO COMPILE THIS ONE BEFORE TRYING TO USE IT WITH THE EXEC.

THIS PROGRAM MAKES A HIDDEN WORD PUZZLE.  I MUST CONFESS THAT IT IS ONE
OF MY FAVORITES.  GREAT TO MAKE PUZZLES FOR FRIENDS WITH ALL THE HIDDEN
WORDS HAVING SPECIAL MEANING FOR THEM, ALONE. OR, MAKE ONE WITH JUST A
BUNCH OF PEOPLE'S NAMES.  LOTS OF FUN. THE AUTHOR, UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT
KNOWN.  I CONVERTED IT FOR OASIS.  FB
