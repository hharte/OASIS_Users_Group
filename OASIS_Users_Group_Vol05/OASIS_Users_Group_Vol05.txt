1 July 1981



Dear Member:

Well here it is the fifth volume.  Two years ago it didn't seem
possible that we would actually have an operating Users' Group,
little lone already five volumes of user contributed public
domain software.  But, here it is.  And, this is only the tip
of the iceberg.  We have so much in the tubes nearing completion
that I can't believe it sometimes!

This prompts me to ask an obvious question publicly, that a few
of you have asked privately: Why do we need propretary software?

In some cases, we may not need it where there is already something
in the public domain that will solve our immediate problem.  But,
some of the stuff out there is copyrighted with permission for end
users to use it, but not to sell it for profit.  Everything I add
to the library of my own, I handle that way.

Then, there is the time it takes to customize an existing package
to do precisely what a customer wants it to do.  Time is money and
it is often (usually?) cheaper to buy something that will already
do your job than to try to massage existing public domain software
to do it.  That is less of a problem for hobbyists than for people
who are trying to make a living selling systems with reliable,
operating software.  And, no one guarentees to maintain public
domain software.  If you find a bug, that's tough!  You fix it or
wait for some other member to fix it.

Finally, there are those remarkable software undertakings that are
just too valuable to be contributed to the public domain until the
original authors have gotten back a reasonable financial return on
their intellectual investment.  Everyone deserves to be compensated
for their efforts - ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.  Some of the things we are
doing for the Users' Group I think we are doing with the knowledge
that others are doing the same thing so that we are going to be
"paid in kind."  Some of it, I know, we are doing for the pure
pleasure of it!

I have the feeling that one day most application software will be
either free or automatically generated by trivial instructions that
anyone of normal intellegence can understand without special training.
People are already talking that way, so I'm sure it is going to
happen sooner or later.  It will take something more than efficiently
run Users' Groups to bring it about, but I think the process is
already under way.  If users' groups could do it, there would no
longer be any commercial software, because groups have been around for
at least twenty years.  There has been excellent free or near free
software in many of their libraries for at least that long (eg the
PDP-8 Users' Group library was/is loaded).

But, something new is happening.  People are finally paying attention
to the human interface with machines in a way which their preoccupation
with the hardware would not allow in the past.  Now, at last, we are
beginning to shift some of our brain power towards the problems of how
to make machines friendly to real people - not just the computer Gurus.
And you programmers/system analysts out there, no need to panic.  The
more effective/productive computers make housewives/bakers/baseball
players, the greater will be their appetites for even more complex
capabilities.  And, there is no end to the cycle, at least that I can
imagine.  The computer professional's jobs will be changing, but there
will be even more of them.  Where only a few hobbyists have their own
personal computers to command, computers will pervade every aspect of
our lives sooner than most of us guess.  As the cost of the hardware
continues to decline and as the list of previously solved software
problems continues to grow,  there will be virtually no reason not to
add intellegence to any process/environment where it makes any sense
at all to do it.  When it only costs an extra dollar to turn the lights
on and off in a room in response to the presence or absence of a person
who needs them, such a feature will be added to every room in the
modern world.  Etc., etc., etc.

Now for some practical comments on things of import.

Volume 5 is the best so far, at least in my opinion.  The COMPARE, DM,
and DS are really going to help a lot.  The diskfile library system
(ADD and FIND) solved one of my immediate problems and I am sure you
will want to use it to keep track of the location of all your various
pieces of software.  To conserve Vol 5 disk space, I didn't leave any
unused space in the DISKFILE.LIBRARY file included on this disk, so
you will need to make a new one for your own use - but no big deal.

THE next volume is well on its way and will include a general purpose
SORT - not one of the $100 super fast jobs, but one that works great,
otherwise.  Of course, there are more games coming, too.  Several of
our members are working on the conversion of the BUSINESSMASTER II
business system package from OEM Software.  I purchased a distributor
license for the OASIS USERS' GROUP and will include the converted
version in future volumes!  That is a really BIG deal and I am looking
forward to completing this project, for sure.  From what I've seen,
this is one of the better, fully integrated business packages.  You
will note in the library file that some of the Vol 6 programs are
included, not all, but some.

I am finding that I enjoy coordinating this thing so much that my other
regular business, running The INFO-MART (an on demand information
service), often sucks hind tit (the one without much milk).  But, there
have been a significant number of non-contributing members join so that
I have been able to take out some money compensation along the way.
But, nobody is getting rich.  I've taken in about $1300.00 in fees
since the first of the year and have paid myself about a dollar an hour
(probably a lot less).  I hope that will change.  Everyone deserves to
be fairly compensated for their efforts, including me.  I'm not
complaining, because this thing is really a lot of fun, as well.

Well, so long for now. Keep the contributions coming in and tell your
friends/enimies/BULLETIN BOARDS, etc. that we are working on vol 6.

Peace,

Hi, Fred:                                                     27 May 1981

     Just received VOL$01; I appreciate the quick response to my request.  I
have several comments to make, so here goes, starting with the most general
ones:

     1.  How about calling the users' group "CARAVAN"?  It seems to me that
a caravan is certainly a group of oasis users, and it is handier, I think,
than "OASIS USERS' GROUP" and cuter than "OUG".  Also, I haven't been able
to come up with any neat acronym.

     2.  I would suggest a standardized "Table of Contents" for each volume,
including the following:

          $LIST$ME FIRST    - A brief intro for new people.
          $VOL$xx  COMMENTS - Information (a la ZOSO) about the programs in
                              this volume.
          $VOL$xx  NEWSLETR - The "letters to the editor" file of users'
                              responses to previous volumes.
          CARAVAN  LIBRARY  - An indexed file of all volumes to date.
          FIND     EXEC     - Utility exec to assist users (explained in
                              $LIST$ME FIRST).
          FIND     BASICCOM - Called by FINDDISK EXEC, accesses the LIBRARY.

     Users could be encouraged to send comments (for inclusion in the next
NEWSLETR) in a text file called $VOL$xx FEEDBACK, as I have done here.

     3.  I think it would be appropriate to assume the following knowledge
on the part of CARAVAN members:

          a. The uses of the FILELIST command.  (I toyed with the thought that
     a "CONTENTS" file should be included on each disk, but that is pointless
     when anyone who has any familiarity with OASIS would know enough to list
     the contents of a disk.)

          b. The uses of the LIST command.  It seems to me safe to assume that
     users would be as familiar with this as they are with direct execution of
     EXEC files, so I would urge that information (like this) be put in a text
     file with a name and filetype that encourage people to LIST it.  The idea
     you had of using an EXEC file to introduce the material on the disk was
     certainly worth trying, but there are a couple of problems: 1) There is
     no way I can figure out to get a neat hard copy of the information in the
     EXEC file; and 2) In order to get to the end I have to go all the way
     through.  I don't mind doing that once, but since I can't get a good
     printout I would have to do it each time I wanted any of the information.
     This could be solved, I suppose, with a menu-driven set-up, but that
     looks like more trouble than it is worth.

          c.  The use of the RUN command as applicable (only) to BASICCOM
     files.

          d.  The use of the BASIC command to convert BASICOBJ files to
     BASICCOM files.  IF we assume users know how to do this, only OBJ files
     need be included on the disks.  If we assume they definitely do NOT know
     how to do this, of course, then both BASICOBJ and BASICCOM files need to
     be included.  My feeling is that while most users would be able to handle
     the conversion, and including only BASICOBJ files on the disk would save
     time at your end, it is better to include both types unless a) you only
     have the BASICCOM, or b) you get in a real time crunch so far as copying.

          e.  The use of EDIT to build a text file.

     4.  EXEC files to introduce systems are a good idea, but I would suggest
that we adhere to a couple of rules:  a. Each EXEC should have a -HELP section
so users can follow the standard OASIS procedure of typing the exec name fol-
lowed by HELP and get assistance.  To take this a step further, the -HELP rou-
tine should also probably follow the format PHASE ONE uses, with FUNCTION,
SYNTAX, and RULES sections.  b. The -HELP section should not automatically
drop you into program execution.  (It's nice to know you can get information
about the program without getting caught in it . . .)

     5.  All programs (including EXECs) should have remarks (or print state-
ments) at the top identifying the program, the author, date, and preferably
a brief description of the intended function of the program.  Obviously, the
more information of this type, the better, but some minimum ought to be es-
tablished (author and date?).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


     Despite the above comments, I'd say "super start"!  I'll be contributing
as much as I can, and look forward to future volumes.

Hi, Fred:

     At long last, here is my reply to the stuff you most expeditiously sent.
Wish I could get things back to you as quick as you get them to me;  how do
you do it?

     The other side of this disk is a model of my how I would format and send
volume 1, based on the suggestions I've included in the file on this side
called "$VOL$01 FEEDBACK".  I've not yet taken the time to go through volumes
2-4 well enough to give in-depth feedback to you, though I did ADD them to
the CARAVAN.LIBRARY copy on this side of the disk.  (The copy on the other
side just has volume 1 files cataloged.)

     The one comment I would make, though we discussed it on the phone, is
that I don't think the "VOLxx EXEC" is a very good idea, because of the dif-
ficulty of getting a hard copy of the information contained therein, and the
difficulty of accessing the information without going through all the prior
info in the file.

     On this side of the disk I have put the ADD program.  This is the special
version I modified just for the purpose of maintaining the CARAVAN.LIBRARY so
I'm not sure it is the best one for general distribution.  Perhaps better is
the revised FILEDISK program, also enclosed.

     In modifying the ADD program I also modified the LIBRARY file to hold a
category for each file.  In working with the files on the volumes I have so
far, I've come up with twelve different categories:

     ASM      - Assembly language routines.
     BUSINESS - Programs applicable to or adaptible to businesses.
     FINANCES - Personal financial assistance (LOAN, BUDGET, etc.).
     GAME     - Interactive entertainment.
     INFO     - General or specific information, provided via the program.
     MAILLIST - The mailing list files you have set up for the users' group.
     POSTER   - Any program that ends up as a picture.
     PRINTOUT - Programs that print tables, charts, etc.
     STATS    - Statistical analyses.
     TEXT     - Files designed just for listing.
     TUTORIAL - Programs designed to help you learn something.
     UTILITY  - Programs to help you do something with your computer.

As you run ADD, the computer asks you for the category for each file it pro-
cesses.  If you just hit RETURN, it will use whatever category it had on file
(if any), which is displayed 10 spaces to the left of the question mark.  The
ADD program also generates a printout (to the printer) of the file names and
categories.  For a sample, you can ADD the contents of this disk to the en-
closed CARAVAN.LIBRARY (though you may want to copy the present LIBRARY else-
where first).

     The FIND program on the other side is also specially designed to deal
with the CARAVAN.LIBRARY, including the capability of searching for the
"category" as part of the key.  The FINDDISK program on this side of the disk
is more general, and probably a better bet for general distribution.  I've
fixed the wildcard feature (I think).

     Finally, the SORT program, on this side, has been "finished".

     Most of my other comments are in the $VOL$01.FEEDBACK file on this side.
More later, after I get more time to look through the other volumes, work on
the ADDRESS, TELEPHON, and DATABASE systems, and/or get more goodies from you.

     Oh, one more thing.  I've set up a little consulting company, and would
like to get that info onto your mailing list, in place of OAKLAND UNIFIED
SCHOOL DISTRICT RESEARCH DEPARTMENT etc.  I am:

1    OASIS-16 background information, Page 1

                              NEW OASIS-16 ANNOUNCED


          Offering state-of-the-art 16-bit  power and tremendously increased
     capability, OASIS-16 has recently been announced by Phase One Systems.

          As outlined by OASIS-author Tim Williams, new features planned for
     OASIS-16  include  Dynamic  User Partitioning  for up  to  32 users, an
     enhanced  ISAM  file  structure  based  on  B-plus  trees, interprocess
     communications,  incredibly  expanded  memory capacity,  new tape drive
     device drivers, and a full screen editor.

          "OASIS-16 is  designed  to  be  the  most comprehensive  of 16-bit
     operating systems,"  reports Williams.  "You could compare it to an IBM
     OS/MVT as opposed to our current version, which is more like IBM DOS or
     CMS."

          Dynamic Partitioning, File Allocation

          Eliminating fixed  partition  sizes  in  multi-user  environments,
     OASIS-16 gives you greater flexibility and more convenience.

          Automatically determining  where  there is  enough memory to start
     your command/user/task,  OASIS-16 will also release the space when your
     operation is completed.  "Automatic Memory Compression" at command load
     time will collect available memory fragments to create a space for your
     new users whenever necessary.

          Dyanmic File  Allocation  avoids the  need of pre-allocating space
     for major  files.  Your initial file open will create a space that will
     grow  as  large as  necessary.  All  files  are byte-addressable at the
     lowest level to facilitate such unique versatility.

          Giving OASIS   power   approaching   a  virtual   machine-type  of
     operation, the  new  overlay  linker  will  be able  to  create overlay
     structures larger  than available  memory.  This strength will be  used
     internally  by  the  operating system  and will  also  be available for
     end-user programs as well.

          New ISAM File Structure

          Designed like  the proven  IBM VSAM access/storage method, the new
     OASIS-16 ISAM files will feature a Beta-plus tree structure.

          The extended binary  "tree" can be searched from any "branch" down
     to  any  particular  "twig"  or  "leaf"  to  find  any record  desired.
     Modifying,  inserting,  and  retrieving  records  will be  much faster.
     Also,  variable  length  records  will replace  the currently available
     fixed length versions.

          Interprocess Communications, Multi-level Directory


                                        more
1    OASIS-16 background information, Page 2

          More advanced   features   implemented   with   OASIS-16   include
     interprocess communications and a multi-level Directory.

          Performing "task-to-task"  communications,  the  new  interprocess
     communications  will allow  one file  to open a channel to  another and
     communicate  with  it  directly.   This  capability will  be especially
     valuable in large data bases and other interactive applications.

          Creating files  of  files, the  new multi-level directory combines
     similiar and related files into one entry to increase speed and improve
     organization.  For  example, all command files will be collected into a
     single sub-directory.  Listings will be more compact, and sub-directory
     listings will be more efficient to use for a variety of situations.

          Z80 Compatible BASIC, Increased Memory Capacity

          OASIS-16 protects your  investment in applications programs with a
     BASIC  compiler  that  is  completely  compatible  with  earlier  OASIS
     versions.

          BASIC programs  can be  copied over  to the new system, and,  with
     minimal effort, can be configured to run just as before or better.

          Maximum file size with  OASIS-16 has been increased to  273 MBytes
     versus the currently  available 16 MBytes.  What's more,  you will have
     up to 32  volumes of disk packs, for  a total of 8736 MBytes on line at
     any one time, compared to the currently available 128 MBytes.

          Full Screen Editor

          Convenient for  both  program development  and documentation task,
     OASIS-16 will include a new full screen Editor.

          Full cursor controls  and backwards/forward scrolling will enhance
     the  general-purpose  text  editor currently  provided.  Built-in macro
     capability will  allow up to 3 complex chained editing functions with a
     single operation.   Special global, line, and character oriented modify
     commands will also be included.

          Tapes, Bubble Memory Supported

          Both industry  standard tapes  and bubble memory will be supported
     by OASIS-16.

          More than just  a  back-up  utility,  tape  drives will  be  fully
     supported peripheral devices.   You can open files, read  or write, and
     execute  commands  directly  from either  cartridge or IBM-type 9-track
     tapes.

          Smaller, less  expensive  bubble  memory will  enhance many future
     machine  designs.   Treated  as  secondary  storage,  bubble  memory is
     expected  to be  half  the  cost  of  comparable floppy  disk  systems.

                                        more
1    OASIS-16 background information, Page 3

     OASIS-16   will   maximize   the  potential   with  a  state-of-the-art
     implementation.

          High-Level, Portable Source

          Written in  'C', OASIS-16  will be easily transported from initial
     8086  designs   to  the  currently  targeted  Z8000,  68000  and  later
     PDP-series CPU's.

          Williams has  designed his  own optimizer which compresses the 'C'
     object  code by  more than  30%.  With its macro assembler  and linking
     loader,  this  tool  too is  expected to  be  offered as another custom
     development aide.

          "We will  be  investigating  the interest  in our 8086 development
     package," comments Howard  Sidorsky, Phase One president.  "From  a Z80
     system, this  tool  can  filter  Z80  source into  8086  code, and then
     cross-assemble into  8086 object  with the same ease and  efficiency of
     our other development packages."

          Sidorsky adds  that  the  'C' compiler  may also  be  offered as a
     stand-alone option.

          Priority Scheduling, Enhanced EXEC Job Control Language

          Especially helpful in  multi-user environments with many different
     operations being  performed at  the same time, new Priority  Scheduling
     will assign up  to 8 different precedency levels  as part of the log-on
     profile.  System  managers will be able to perform necessary operations
     in  a  more orderly  fashion without  impacting  the efficiency of your
     organization.

          Enhancements to the EXEC JCL will allow using words with more than
     eight characters  and pass an unlimited number of arguements.  Numerous
     new  command  verbs have  been added, including FOR/NEXT, REPEAT/WHILE,
     DO/UNTIL,  and many  others.  Additional changes allow more convientent
     structuring and syntax.

          Written in  'C', OASIS-16  will be easily transported from initial
     8086 designs to the currently targeted Z8000, 68000 and other CPU's.

          Williams has  designed his  own optimizer which compresses the 'C'
     object  code by  more than  30%.  With its macro assembler  and linking
     loader,  this  tool  too is  expected to  be  offered as another custom
     development aide.

          "We will  be  investigating  the interest  in our 8086 development

     package," comments Howard  Sidorsky, Phase One president.  "From  a Z80
     system, this  tool  can  filter  Z80  source into  8086  code, and then
     cross-assemble into  8086 object  with the same ease and  efficiency of
     our other development packages."

          Sidorsky adds  that  the  'C' compiler  may also  be  offered as a
     stand-alone option.

               NEW PASCAL OPTION TO OASIS OPERATING SYSTEM ANNOUNCED


          Combining the structured programming capability of Pascal with the
     power of a multi-user software system, a new Pascal option to the OASIS
     operating system has recently been released by Phase One Systems.

          With many extension to  the UCSD Pascal from which  it is modeled,
     OASIS   Pascal   easily   allows  separate   compilation  of  routines.
     Construction  of  procedure  libraries  are  provided by  new 'module',
     'export  block', and  'import block' declarations.  Separately compiled
     modules  are assembled  into linking  loader  formats and combined with
     other  modules  to  form libraries  of routines  and  global variables.
     Without  restrictions  on  the  order  of declarations,  any constants,
     types, variables  and routine  definitions may be grouped together  for
     better  reading  and  modularity.   Variables  can  be  initialized and
     explicit   type   conversion  is   allowed.   Furthermore,  syntax  for
     structured   constants  has   been  added.   Integer  literals  may  be
     represented in  a radix other than decimal, and standard Pascal I/O has
     been extended in several ways.

          Complementing currently  available Macro  Assembler, BASIC, COBOL,
     FORTH, and  FORTRAN high  level language, the new Pascal  option to the
     single  and  multi-user  OASIS is  available from microcomputer dealers
     world wide at a suggested US retail price of $450.00.

          Phase One  Systems,  internationally  respected  operating  system
     specialists,  are  headquartered  at  7700 Edgewater  Drive, Suite 830,

1                  NEW OASIS TRAINING CLASSES TO BE STARTED SOON


          Responding to  a  growing  demand  for  an  increased  variety  of
     support, Phase One has recently organized a number of training sessions
     which will  provide insights  into all facets of how  to get the utmost
     performance from OASIS operating system software.

          "Because OASIS is different  and so much more advanced  than other
     available microcomputer operating  systems, we have found a  great deal
     of interest on the part of potential and actual users, distributors and
     microcomputer  OEM's,"  explains  Chris  Langewis,  Vice  President  of
     International  Marketing  and  prime mover  behind the training classes
     concepts.   "We want  an  efficient  and  effective  way to  deal  with
     prospective and  actual users who say 'Tell me more about the potential
     of OASIS.'"

          Langewis hopes  that  the  initial classes  will serve students in
     making informed decisions when using OASIS, while more detailed classes
     will  cover  in-depth  questions important  to the  most  serious user,
     large-scale distribution outlets or microcomputer manufacturers.

          Prepared and presented by experienced instructors, each class will
     be limited  in size to provide the optimum amount of attention with all
     involved.   Each  class level  will be given "hands-on" indoctrination.
     Complete audio/visual and documentation facilities will provide a ready
     reference   to  all   information  requests.   Certificates  of  course
     completion will also be awarded.

          Entry Level Learning

          Non-programmers and   novice  prospective   OASIS  users  will  be
     introduced  to  the fundamentals  of most  operations  performed by the
     operating system.

          "Frankly, this is  the type  of thing that we get  calls about all
     the time; 'how do I do this?', 'what does this mean?'.  The more people
     begin to explore the full range of OASIS capability, the more they want
     to  know,"  relates Langewis.   "Our Novice  class  will be designed to
     briefly introduce each  of the OASIS modules with  enough foundation so
     that you can explore more deeply and productively afterwards."

          OASIS dealers  and  distributors  are  expected  to be  especially
     interested in  the benefits  of this introductory class.  According  to
     Langewis,  distribution outlets  will see  more and more how OASIS  can
     improve their  customer's systems.   At the same time, they  will learn
     several  basic  steps  that  will improve  relationships throughout the
     distribution chain.

          "For example, everyone should know that the first task they should
     accomplish  is  to make  a back-up  disk,"  said Langewis.  "Also, this
     class  will  help  people  understand  the tremendous  advantages OASIS
     offers in  the standard  system that other available operating  systems
     can only dream about."

          Re-entrant language  usage,  system and  configuration management,
1    account  and security  structures, the  EXEC  job control language, and
     special commands like ATTACH are included in the class agenda.

          Systems Integrator Orientation

          Detailed information  on  the structure  and make-up of OASIS will
     constitute the majority of the second level of training.

          "Emphasis here will  be to  give you detailed information on,  for
     example, how  our software drivers actually coordinate the interface to
     different  peripherals,"  described  Langewis.  "From  there we'll take
     you, the  more experienced programmer, into how to use machine language
     subroutines from  BASIC, how  to take advantage of certain  OASIS BASIC
     utilities, and other superior programming tools."

          Starting from  what  most programmers  already know, the level two
     class  will progress  into advanced microcomputer programming utilities
     that are unique  to OASIS.  Examples will cover  such principles as how
     drivers are structured and interfaced for the best performance, machine
     language  programming  and macro  debugger, advanced EXEC routines, and
     how to quickly convert programs from foreign operating systems.

          Advanced Utilization Seminar

          Manufacturers, master distributors  and software houses can become
     intimately familiar with OASIS architecture in the third level classes.

          "Designed to help  the manufacturer improve existing OASIS systems
     or  prepare  for  implementing  OASIS  on  new  enhancements  to  their
     products,  this  course will  probably be  restricted  to only the most
     serious  of OASIS  users and  those organizations who sell 100  or more
     OASIS installations  a year,"  predicts Langewis.  "But it will  be the
     definitive  center for  quickly learning  how best to modify OASIS  for
     custom implementations or conditions; the real 'nitty-gritty'."

          Participants in   this   level   will   be  able   to  master  the
     macro-assembler in detail, or structure their own new utilities such as
     graphics or voice recognition possibilities.

          World-wide Support

          In addition to  the pilot  program to be organized in  the Oakland
     headquarters  sometime in  mid-year, other training facility franchises
     are planned for most major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, and
     Dallas/Fort  Worth,  Chicago,  and Denver.   European centers currently
     being  investigated   include  London,  Munich,  Frankfurt,  Paris  and
     Amsterdam.

          Initially, each   class    will   be   planned   for   2-3   days.
     Non-programmer/Novice  level  classes  will  eventually  be held  every
     month.  Quarterly Systems Integrator level classes will be complimented
     by semi-annual Advanced Utilization level classes.

                 January 12, 1981


                NEW OASIS VERSION 5.5 OFFERS FASTER BASIC COMPILER,

             SPOOLER, MEDIA INDEPENDENT BACK-UP, AND KEYED FILE ACCESS


          Providing a  much faster  BASIC compiler, a shared printer between
     up to 15  users, media-independent back-up capabilities and  fast Keyed
     file access, the  new OASIS Version 5.5 microcomputer  operating system
     is now available from Phase One Systems.

          Nearly twice as fast as previously available models, the new OASIS
     Version 5.5  BASIC compiler also offers an approximately 25-45% further
     reduction in  the size  of compiled programs.  New security  parameters
     let you specify serial numbers and privilege levels down to the program
     level,   an  especially   attractive  option  to  independent  software
     suppliers.

          With up  to  15 users  accessing a  single  printer, the new OASIS
     Version  5.5  Multi-user  SPOOLER  allows maximum  printing efficiency.
     Twenty-six user-defined queues  can be used to prioritize  waiting jobs
     or  execute  special  forms  such  as  checks  or invoices.   Automatic
     reprints,  multiple  copies,  or  special  alignment parameters  can be
     easily specified.

          Archive and Restore, a sophisticated OASIS back-up utility, can be
     used to  protect  even very  large amounts  of  hard disk data on  tape
     cartridge  or multiple  floppies.  Special benefits include compressing
     data to  save storage space, read-back check, and flexible options such
     as only  saving  data that  has been  changed  or added since the  last
     archive operation.

          Designed especially  for  files that  are often updated but rarely
     accessed  sequentially, new  Keyed file capabilities compliment OASIS's
     existing direct,  sequential and ISAM files.  Under Keyed access, files
     can be  retrieved and updated much faster than under other methods, and
     use less disk overhead in the process.

          Other features  of  the  OASIS  operating  system  include  unique
     flexibility  in  maintaining  public,  private  or  shared  files  with
     versatile security  and accounting controls; file locking and automatic
     record   locking  to   insure  data  integrity;  convenient  inter-user
     communications; and a general purpose text editor.

          Comprehensive program  development  support  offered  by  the  new
     version includes high level BASIC with re-entrant run-time module; EXEC
     interactive  job  control  language;  text  editors;  relocating  macro
     assembler/debugger/linkage editor;  and diagnostic/conversion programs.

                                       (more)
1    RM COBOL (ANSI '74) is optionally available.

          Available from  microcomputer   dealers  worldwide,  suggested  US
     retail price  for the OASIS option is $500 for single-user and $850 for
     multi-user versions.

          Phase One  Systems,  internationally  respected  operating  system
     specialists,  are  headquartered  at  7700 Edgewater  Drive, Suite 830,
     Oakland, CA 94621, (415) 562-8085, TWX 910-366-7139.

1                NEW OASIS VERSION 5.5 OFFERS MULTI-USER SPOOLER,

                 MEDIA-INDEPENDENT BACK-UP, AND KEYED FILE ACCESS


          Providing a  shared printer  between up to 15 users, significantly
     faster  and  more  efficient BASIC  compiler, media-independent back-up
     capabilities and Keyed file access, the new OASIS version 5.5 operating
     system for Z80 microcomputers is now available from Phase One Systems.

          In design, development  and testing for over a year, OASIS Version
     5.5  is  the  Phase One  System latest  response  to growing demand for
     flexible multi-user  systems.  Each new module and feature is patterned
     after proven, successful  mainframe utilities to give system  users the
     versatility they've come to expect from OASIS.  All previously prepared
     application programs are directly compatible.

          Printer SPOOLER Increases Efficiency

          With up to  15 users accessing a single printer, the new OASIS 5.5
     Multi-user SPOOLER  (Simultaneous peripheral operations on-line) allows
     maximum  printing  efficiency.   Twenty-six user-defined  queues can be
     used to prioritize waiting jobs or execute special forms such as checks
     or  invoices.  Automatic  reprints and multicopies or special alignment
     parameters can be easily specified.

          Other SPOOLER  options  include:  initialize;  set  the  schedule;
     start/stop   jobs;   list  a   summary  of   waiting   jobs  and  their
     characteristics; kill  or change  the status of a waiting  job; abort a
     running job; back-up "n" pages; or establish an alignment.

          Twice as fast, more efficient BASIC Compiler

          Nearly twice as fast as previously available models, the new OASIS
     Version 5.5  BASIC Compiler also offers an approximately 25-45% further
     reduction in  the size  of compiled programs.  New security  parameters
     let you specify serial numbers and privilege levels down to the program
     level,   an  especially   attractive  option  to  independent  software
     suppliers.

          Along with supporting new  OASIS Keyed file access, the  new BASIC
     Compiler  encourages  stricter  control over  and efficiency of program
     structure.   Comprehensive  error  messages  will guide  programmers in
     effective  debugging   and  streamlining  techniques  to  optimize  the
     compiler's new features.

          Sophisticated Back-up Utilities

          Archive and Restore, sophisticated OASIS back-up utilities, can be
     used to  protect  even very  large amounts  of  hard disk data on  tape
     cartridge   or  multiple   floppies.   Special  benefits  include  data
     compression  to  minimize storage  space, read-back check, and flexible
     options such as  only saving data that has  been changed or added since
     the  last archive  operation.  Up  to 128 Mbytes of data  can be easily
     archived or restored.

1         This advanced utility virtually eliminates any previous hesitation
     and  doubt about  using Winchester-type hard disks within microcomputer
     configurations.   Importance of  Archive capability will grow as newer,
     larger, more cost-effective  hard disk systems become available  to the
     typical systems user.  OASIS is prepared now to meet the challenge.

          Keyed Files

          Designed especially for files with alphanumeric keyed records that
     are often  updated directly but rarely accessed sequentially, new Keyed
     file  capabilities  compliment OASIS's  existing direct, sequential and
     ISAM files.  Under  Keyed access, records can be  retrieved and updated
     much faster than under other methods, and use less disk overhead in the
     process.

          Typical applications   where  Keyed   file  access  will  be  very
     convenient include  General Ledger, Point of Purchase, Library Storage,
     Inventory   Up-date,  and   other  situations  where  rapid,  real-time
     processing saves time and effort.

          Scheduled for  delivery  in  April,  more information  about OASIS
     Version  5.5 can  be obtained  through  local dealers and distributors.
     Cost for system up-grades will be minimal.

1                FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:


               OASIS DRIVERS NOW AVAILABLE FOR XCOMP DISC CONTROLLER


          Providing a convenient  and efficient method to move up to faster,
     larger media devices, the OASIS operating system for Z80 microcomputers
     now supports the XCOMP DCF10 Disc Controller.

          Eliminating the  need  for  user-written driver  programs, the new
     OASIS   software  supports   the  XCOMP  DCF10  disk  controller  which
     interfaces  to a  variety of  popular  2315/5440 type cartridge drives.
     This new capability  is especially helpful to users  who are looking to
     expand from floppy-disk only systems to faster, large capacity versions
     of the popular  high performance storage medium.  Archive  and Restore,
     OASIS's sophisticated  back-up utilities, enhance the new configuration
     capabilities.

          Other features   of    the   OASIS   operating   system   include:
     compatibility   between   single   and   multi-user  versions;   unique
     flexibility  in  maintaining  public,  private  or  shared  files  with
     versatile security  and accounting controls; file locking and automatic
     record  locking  to  insure  data  integrity;  and  advanced ISAM  file
     structures.  Multi-user  SPOOLER, convenient inter-user communications,
     general  purpose  text  editor  and  comprehensive program  development
     support are additional OASIS features.

          Supplied with  the  XCOMP drivers  at a  nominal  charge, OASIS is
     available  from  microcomputer  dealers  worldwide at  the suggested US
     retail price of $500 for single-user and $850 for multi-user versions.

DISKFILE.LIBRARY

(NOTE: THESE PROGRAMS WERE COMPILED UNDER OASIS VERSION 5.4 AND WILL NOT
RUN WITH 5.5 OR LATER.  PLEASE RECOMPILE THEM FOR YOUR SYSTEM BEFORE USING.)

This is a system for keeping track of the contents of a library of disk(ette)s.
With it you can ADD (and delete) the contents of any diskette residing on any
drive.  You can also remove all references to any named disk(ette).  The FIND
program is used to find the location of any file or class of files in your
library.  We are using the system to keep track of the Oasis Users' Group
library contents as it grows. The information about the files in the library
are maintained in a file called DISKFILE.LIBRARY.  It is important that you
be aware of the possibility of confusion, if you maintain more than one
copy of DISKFILE.LIBRARY in your system.

It was contributed to the library by its author, Joe Trimble.  I am sure you
will find it to be one of the more usefull utilities in our collection. FB

program.  In no time at all you'll be broke and feel just like you would
five thousand miles away in one of the noisy casinos.  The author of this

ASEBALL.BASICOBJ

What can you say about a game that makes you sit still at a computer terminal
to play an action game like baseball?  I'm sure those of you who find
themselves glued to the boob-toob during baseball season will welcome this
equally inane substitute. It is one way to bridge the generation gap.  The
jargon is all here and, if mastered, will make you look like a real pro to
your twelve year old kid.  It's included here mostly for the baseball
widows, who think a "fly ball" is a dance for insects.

The original version of this program was written by Joel Lind and Ken Berkman
in 1973. It has been revised several times; the last time by me for OASIS.  FB

Put some logs in the fireplace; get some hot mulled wine; a copy of the
latest Play(boy/girl) magazine; and settle down for a long, looooooong
game.  Randykoff (as I call the computer logic) plays a legal game, but
takes as much as 10 minutes to make his move each time.  I'm sure there
must be a more efficient chess program out there in OASIS-land somewhere.
He doesn't seem to remember from one move to the next what he learned about
the possibilities during his analysis of the previous move.  And, he
doesn't seem to look ahead very many moves, but I must admit to not spending
very much time studying the program's logic.

The program was written originally by Randy Miller in 1976 and modified for
OASIS by me in 1981.  FB

If you have ever spent 20 minutes trying to figure out what tiny little,
inconsequential change you made to your BASIC program last week that now
is causing trouble, this new utility is for you.  It checks two programs
(or any sequential files) line by line and displays mis-matches.  As soon
as it finds an extra line in either program, all subsequent pairs of lines
are flagged as mis-matches.  I wish it had a little more intellegence and
could handle the extra line problem, but it still is a valuable utility
as it is.  It was submitted by its author, Gary Thompson of Design Systems.
I have made minor changes in the NOTES file and added the COMPARE$.EXEC. FB

OMPILE.EXEC

The BASIC programs on this disk were compiled under OASIS VERSION 5.4B

If you have a later or earlier version on your system, they may not run
properly.  This utility makes it simple to recompile programs using your
version of the compiler.  My plan is to include only object programs at
some point in the future and rely on each member to compile a copy for
their particular system.  I need a little more time to think out the
pros and cons of such a move.  If you have some thoughts on the matter,
let me hear from you.  I have changed the overview execs (eg VOL5.EXEC)
to run the BASIC programs using the interpreter so everyone will be
able to at least review the new programs without a compiled version.

OMPRESS.EXEC

You asked for it, so here it is.  No big deal, just a convenient little
utility to reorganize the files on a diskette so that they are all
contiguous and all of the available space is together at the end of the
files.  It does require that you have a second diskette in another drive
that will be used as a "work space" ( actually, it is used to receive a
backup copy of the files on the disk you want to compress).
